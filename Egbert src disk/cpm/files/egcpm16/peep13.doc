PEEP.COM:  Text File Viewer
Version 1.3  -  5 NOV 87

Version 1.3 Update:
  - V 1.2 introduced a minor bug with major import - typing a non-existent
	command crashed the program!  Very sorry about that.
  - LF's are stripped to make room for a few more K of file.
  - Responds to ^C,^R,^E,^X as per WordStar convention.

Version 1.2 Update:
  - File printing available in "L" version.
  - Tab expansion done internally.  No more line wrap problems.  Long lines 
    are truncated on CRT but sent whole to printer.
  - One line of overlap when scrolling.
  - High bit masking done immediately to avoid problems with listing and 
    finding.

FEATURES:

1.  PEEP is a small program intended as a RAM disk resdient utility
	(a major reason for keeping it to 1k size)
	for viewing and printing text files in a flexible way.

2.  You can do all of the things needed to look through the file
	without moving from the home row. (page, scan, find, etc.)
	No need to keep a (callused) finger on the CTRL key.

3.  Before being displayed, characters are high bit masked.  Control
	characters (except CR, LF, and TAB) are printed in "^" format.
	Thus WordStar files and captured files from a BBS are viewable.

4.  PEEP reads the whole file into available memory.  If the file is
	too big, it reads what does fit, and you can get the rest
	with the R command.

5.  You can set a place marker in the text.

6.  Files may be printed out from the place marker.

7.  The installation file (PEEPINST.ASM) is for terminal installation.
	As is, the program is compatible with Wyse, Televideo, et. al.

	The source contains screen dependent code for:
		INSERT LINE : esc, E
		ERASE TO END OF LINE : esc, T
		HOME CURSOR : 1eh  (^^)
		GOTOXY : esc, =, row+20h, col+20h
		DIM VIDEO ON AND OFF : esc ')' and esc '('

	These are most easily altered with the PEEPINST.ASM file.


USAGE:

Commands are not intended to be mnemonic but are grouped physically for
ease of use.  (Don't panic!  Essentially, the right hand moves ahead and
the left hand moves back through the text.  The main commands are mirror
images, e.g. left index - ahead one screen, right index - back one screen.)

         X - Exit    <sp> - Hop 10 lines    <cr> - Next Screen (F)


Details ->

A Display final screen.                ; Display first screen.

S Scroll continuously forward          L Scroll back until key pressed.

D Move forward one line of text        K Move back one line of text

F Move forward one screen              J Move back one screen

G Find a string                        H Repeat find
  - Search is forward
  - If found, string is contained in the top line of the screen


R - READ:
	If PEEP beeped when reading in the file, additional text may be
	read in.  The new text replaces text currently in memory with one
	screen of overlap.  The beginning of the text can be re-read with
	additional R commands.

O - MARK:
	Sets a pointer to the beginning of the line at top of screen.
	(Home cursor position).  The marker is initialized to the beginning
	of the file.

0 - GO TO MARK:
	Instant return to the marker.

I - INIT:
 	Send initialization string to printer.  It is installed with the
	PEEPINST overlay.

P - PRINT:
	Send text from MARK to bottom of current screen to printer.
	Abort listing with ^C.  Although long lines are truncated on the
	terminal display, they are sent whole to the printer.

T - TYPE:
	Type a line to the printer, e.g. comments.  A blank line sends a
	CRLF to the printer.


				 ----
Known bugs:
1.  The FIND function uses BDOS function 10.  Injudicious use of ^P, ^U
	etc. can lead to unexpected results.


Note:  PEEP is a bare-bones version of VIEW.  The same style of file viewing
is also used in VCOMP (compare two text files) and BCOMP (compare two binary
files).  The latter three are for ZCPR3 users.  PEEP is also available as
an RCP segment.
