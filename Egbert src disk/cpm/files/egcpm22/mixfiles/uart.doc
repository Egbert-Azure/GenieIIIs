	BSTAM from Byrom Software Inc.
	------------------------------

The BSTAM system distributed as TRANSMIT.COM and
RECEIVE.COM have not been installed for any 
specific UART/USART chips. 

To the Heath/TRS-80 user, the programs have installed
the TRS-80 interface. The source is U1602/43.ASM, and
is set up for 9600BD.

Other files are supplied with the system as further
examples of interfacing. The user should familiarize
himself with the I/O requirements of the system to
be equipped and edit and assemble an appropriate
I/O interface module. This is installed thus:

	A> ASM UART	assemble UART.ASM, your own
			interface

	A> DDT RECEIVE.COM
	   I UART.HEX
	   R		read UART.HEX over RECEIVE.COM
	   ^C		boot
	A> SAVE 27 RECEIVE2.COM
			save the patched file with a
			temporary name for testing

	A> DDT TRANSMIT.COM
	   I UART.HEX
	   R
	   ^C		same again for transmit
	A> SAVE 35 TRANSMI2.COM


The files RECEIVE2 and TRANSMI2 will now be customized
to your own I/O patches, and can be tested.

Don't forget that if two computers are taking to each other
along an RS232 cable set, one must appear as a data terminal
to the other. This normally involves reversing the leads
between pins 2 and 3 of one of the EIA connectors.



	Machine 1		Machine 2
	---------		---------

	  PIN 2       to	  PIN 3

	  PIN 3       to	  PIN 2

	  PIN 7       to          PIN 7


No other handshaking is required, since all of the acknowlegement
is performed in software.
