		SLR180 1.30 Release Notes

Bugs Fixed From 1.00:

Nested macro calls using % operator fixed
IFIDN	<>,<>	now returns true
JR	NUMBER+$	generates correct code
INCLUDE and MACLIB filenames can now contain +, -, etc
Fixed number conversion in non-power-of-two radix
.$$1 files are cleaned up on abort
	LD	A,TYPE 0	works
ex	af,af'		works in U/L mode


Additions:

All input and output files are always closed upon termination (unless
terminated by ^C from BUFIN call).

CONFIG option added to allow TABs in strings.  Normally SLR180 complains
about any control characters in quoted strings but generates the correct
code.  This option suppress the error if the control character is a TAB.

CONFIG option added to disable stripping the high bit of each byte read
from the input source.  THIS IS DANGEROUS!  Should ONLY be used for using
non-ASCII characters in comments.  DO NOT USE in macros, since the high
bit is used as a parameter replacement flag.  Other indexed tables also
assume the high bit is clear.



                    SLR180 1.31 Release Notes

SLR180 will now delete A:$$$.SUB if an error was detected during any assembly
(Configurable with 180FIG).  This complements the setting of the ZCPR3 error
flag, and the setting of the CP/M 3.0 Error return code (******* CP/M Plus
users:  SUBMIT files may test the error return code with a leading 'colon',
documented obscurely in CP/M 3 Programmers Guide 1.6.3 *******).

180fig will now set an alternate user # to be used if a given source file
cannot be found under the default user #.  Useful for keeping just one copy 
of system equates and macro libraries under a single user #.

180fig will let you define a drive to be used for storing intermediate files.
This should be set to your fastest device.

180fig will let you select Common selection to start back at address relative
0 (M80 compat), or continue at the last used address (like any other address
space).

180fig will select whether or not to print the 'nesting level' character in
the listing.

^C will now abort the assembler, not just the current assembly.

Colon not required on equated labels not in column one, even when that
requirement is selected.

Labeled IRP and IRPC's work.

Forward referenced EQU's work in one-pass mode.
