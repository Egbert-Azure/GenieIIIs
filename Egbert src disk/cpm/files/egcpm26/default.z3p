
; DEFAULT.Z3P file -- Z3PLUS default system descriptor values

; (11/05/89)
; Changed for Volker Dose - Genie IIIs Holte CP/M 3a 03.10.90
; jetzt auch mit 10 MB Festplatte C:
; The syntax here is:
;
; VARIABLENAME = VALUE ; any comment
;
; values are DECIMAL by default
;
;	 nn. is also DECIMAL
;	 nnH is HEX
;      nnnnB is BINARY
;
; The '=' sign isn't required.  You can also use 'equ',
; or just a space or tab separator.

;-------------------------

; THE FOLLOWING VALUES SHOULD ALWAYS BE ADJUSTED TO DESCRIBE YOUR SYSTEM.

EXPATHS = 5



; vector of valid drives, bit 0 is A:...bit 15 is P:
; set a 0 digit for each unavailable drive (binary number ends with 'B')

DRVVEC  = 1101000000000111B	;  <-- set bits for valid drives
;         PONMLKJIHGFEDCBA

; The highest drive and user number that may be accessed
; by the command processor when loading a file or parsing
; a command line.

MAXDRV	= 16	; note --> A: = 1, ... P: = 16
MAXUSR	= 15	; 15 is the limit for CP/M 3 bdos

; Clock speed of your computer

SPEED	=  7	; cpu in mhz

; CRT definitions

COLS	= 80	; CRT terminal width
ROWS	= 24	; total rows (lines)
LINS	= 22	; rows of text

; Printer definitions

PCOL	= 80	; PRT width
PROW	= 72	; total rows (lines)
PLIN	= 64	; total lines of text
FORM	=  1	; 1 if printer can form-feed using form-feed character

;-------------------------

; THE FEATURES AND MEMORY REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR Z3PLUS SYSTEM ARE
DETERMINED
; BY THE FOLLOWING VALUES.  Values marked with '*' should not
normally be
; changed.

; Z-System segment sizes (in 128-byte records)

Z3ENVS	=   2	; * environment size (1 + 1 for termcap)
CCPS	=  20	; * command processor size
RCPS 	=  18	;   resident command package size
FCPS	=   5	;   flow command package size

; Z-System segment sizes (in other units)

Z3NDIRS	=  25	;   names in named directory register
Z3CLS	= 200   ;   MULTIPLE COMMAND LINE (max value =250)

;-------------------------

; OTHER ITEMS THAT YOU ARE LESS LIKELY TO WANT TO CHANGE.

; The name of the startup command that is executed when Z3PLUS
; is loaded for the first time.  That command may be an alias,
; to load terminal definition, error handler, shell, or whatever.

STARTUP = STARTZ3P	; ascii string, no spaces

; The command search path for a file.  Use one to five pairs
; of drive-usernumber combinations. "$" means the current drive
; or user number.  The final pair is the "root" directory, and


PATH = m0$$c1c0

; Other environment parameters

QUIET	=  0	; 1 if commands are to be silent
WHEEL	= FFh	; 0 to disable protected commands

DUOK	=  1	; 1 if ok to change directory using drive-user: form

;-------------------------

; DO NOT CHANGE ANY OF THE FOLLOWING VALUES

;CRT	= 0
;PRT	= 0

; These environment variables are reserved for future
; development.

SPAR1	0	; spare byte at z3env+36h

SPAR2	0	; spare bytes at z3env+3Bh
SPAR3	0	; +3Ch
SPAR4	0	; +3Dh
SPAR5	0	; +3Eh

; The environment type should be left set to 80h.
; Future developments may use higher values.

ENVTYP	= 80h	; environment type
