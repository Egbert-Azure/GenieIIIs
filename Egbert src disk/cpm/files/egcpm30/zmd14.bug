Subject: Bug in ZMP 1.4's dialing routine

There is a slight bug in ZMP 1.4's dialing routine.  It sends a
linefeed as well as a carriage return to the modem causing some
modems to hang up before dialing.  Here's where the faulty code
resides:

0B82        LD        HL,0Ah
0B85        PUSH        HL
0B86        CALL        1437

To fix this bug, put zeroes in locations 0B82h-0B88h (opcode for
NOP) and then save the program using the command:

A>SAVE 56 ZMP.COM

Happy modeming!
