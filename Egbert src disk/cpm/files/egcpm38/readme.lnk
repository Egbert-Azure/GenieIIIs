SLRNK 1.30 NOTES


THE CONFIG PROGRAM HAS BEEN RENAMED LNKFIG.  TO SET SLRNK & SLRIB OPTIONS,

A>LNKFIG SLRNK.COM

OR

A>LNKFIG SLRIB.COM

BUGS FIXED:

$memry	WAS EVALUATED INCORRECTLY IN SOME CASES
LOWEST MEMORY ADDRESS SOMETIMES INCORRECT


ADDITIONS SINCE 1.20:

ZCPR3 ERROR FLAG SUPPORTED
/K	OPTION CLEARS ERROR FLAG TO THAT POINT
/I FILES MAY CONTAIN COMMENTS STARTING WITH :
INPUT FILES ARE CLOSED
LIMIT OF 63 COMMON BLOCKS REMOVED
TABLES OPTIMIZED TO ALLOW 1-3K LARGER LINKS
/E CAN NOW TAKE OPTIONAL :NUMBER AS START ADDRESS
:NUMBER NOW CAN BE A HEX NUMBER OR VALID, DEFINED SYMBOL
UNINITIALIZED SPACES NOW FILLED, NO LONGER RANDOM
DISK OUTPUT MUCH FASTER ON SOME SYSTEMS
LIBRARIES OPENED R/O MODE UNDER MP/M


NEW LNKFIG OPTIONS:

1K OR 2K BUFFER:  YOU CAN SELECT THE SIZE DISK I/O BUFFER YOU WANT.  2K IS
FASTER, BUT 1K WILL ALLOW YOU TO LINK APPROXIMATELY A 1K LARGER FILE.

FILL VALUE:  UNINITIALIZED SPACE IS FILLED WITH THIS VALUE.

EMPTY CHAINS:  THIS DETERMINES WHETHER OR NOT SLRNK STRIPS EMPTY EXTERNAL
CHAINS IN MICROSOFT FORMAT.  THEORY:  IF YOU DECLARED A ROUTINE EXTERNAL, BUT
NO LONGER USE IT, SHOULD THE LINKER STILL PULL IT IN FROM YOUR LIBRARY?
NORMALLY YOU WOULD SAY NO, TO PRODUCE THE SMALLEST VALID OUTPUT FILE.  HOWEVER,
SOME COMPILER MANUFACTURERS COULDN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO ORDER THEIR LIBRARIES
SUCH THAT THINGS GOT PULLED IN CORRECTLY, SO THEY STICK EXTERNAL DECLARATIONS
IN HERE AND THERE TO FORCE LOADING OF MODULES.  FOR EXAMPLE, IF SLRNK IS
CONFIGURED TO STRIP EMPTY EXTERNAL CHAINS, SOME AZTEC C FILES WILL NOT LINK
PROPERLY, BUT SOME WILL.  CONFIGURED TO KEEP EMPTY EXTERNAL CHAINS, ALL AZTEC
C STUFF LINKS, BUT THE FILES THAT WORKED BEFORE NOW PRODUCE A USELESSLY LARGER
COM FILE...  COMPATABILITY? L80 KEEPS ALL EMPTY EXTERNAL CHAINS.


SLRNK 1.31 NOTES

SLRNK WILL NOW DELETE A:$$$.SUB IF AN ERROR WAS DETECTED DURING LINK.  LNKFIG
CAN DISABLE THIS.  USEFUL FOR TERMINATING SUBMIT FILES ON ERROR.

LNKFIG WILL NOW SET AN ALTERNATE USER # TO BE USED IF A GIVEN .REL FILE CANNOT
BE FOUND UNDER THE DEFAULT USER #.  USEFUL FOR KEEPING LIBRARIES UNDER DIFFERENT
USER #.

LNKFIG WILL ALSO SET AN ALTERNATE DRIVE TO SEARCH.  AFTER ABOVE SEARCH IS
COMPLETE, ALTERNATE DRIVE IS SELECTED AND USER NUMBER SEARCH STARTED AGAIN.
