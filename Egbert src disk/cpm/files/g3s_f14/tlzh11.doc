                        TYPELZH v11

    TYPELZH is merely a grafting of the separately released LZH 
decoding capability to TYPELZ v22.   Version 1.0 was the Beta 
test.

    TYPELZH treats files with the extension .?Y? as LZH encoded, 
just as the original TYPELZ treated files with the extentions 
.?Z? and .?Q? as CRUNCHED and SQueezed.  Everything else should 
be the same.

    FYI: The offical release of LZH compression and decompression 
is in the library CRLZH11.LBR.  These programs are Z80-only.  
However, there are other 'graftings' of this compression method to 
LT and to the FCRUNCH programs for 8080/8085-only applications.

			 TYPELZ v22


     TYPELZ22  is  functional replacement for the  previous  v1.5
release.  All installation, usage, and switches are identical  to
those of v1.5 as described below.  The main differences are  that
all  of  the data decompression code has been moved  out  of  the
source	into  two .REL files.  This  substantially  shortens  the
source	code, (which was  getting unwieldy), and allows the  pro-
gram  to work with the new v24 type crunched files.  If  the  in-
stallation patches provided prove insufficient, the source can be
reassembled & linked.  There is a short note on linking near  the
beginning of the source code.			  - SGG


INSTALLATION:
=============
     Beginning with version 1.5, virtually ALL user  configurable
options can be implemented by patching the .COM file with DDT  or
PATCH.COM.  See TZINST15.DOC for assistance with installation.


USAGE:
======
 TYPELZ  [d [u]:]  [ <lbr-name> ]  <filename>  [ /o ]

    If	two filenames are specified, it will be assumed that  the
first  is a Library file, in which case the suffix .LBR  will  be
added if it wasn't specified explicitly.

    Drive/user,  drive	only, or neither may  precede  the  first
filename.   The current user# and the currently logged	(default)
drive will be used when either is not specified.


SWITCHES:
=========
    If '/N' is added to the command line, the file will be  typed
without  stopping after every screenful of text.   Otherwise  the
typing	will stop after each screenful (default 23 lines for  one
line  "overlap"  on a 24 line screen). When stopped,  the  prompt
'[more]'  will	be displayed.  If "L", "l", or the space  bar  is
hit,  the  screen will be advanced by a single	line;  any  other
character will cause a full screen advance.  These characters may
be  changed to suit one's personal preference (see source  for	a
full selection of assembly time options).

     If '/L' is added to the command line, and the WHEEL byte  is
non-zero,  the file will be output to the LST: device  (printer.)
Page  ejects will be performed every 60 lines, and tabs  will  be
expanded  to the appropriate number of spaces.	NOTE that if  the
wheel byte is not set, the online USAGE message will not refer to
the '/L' option, and attempting to use it will produce an  "Input
file not found" error.



HISTORY:
========
	       *** Changes for v1.5. [Michael Conley] ***

INSTALLATION  made  easier via improved patch table at	start  of
	      program. See TZINST15.DOC for patching assistance.

CONSOLE       is  now monitored continuously for ^S pause, ^X  or
	      ^C abort.
_________________________________________________________________

	       *** Changes for v1.4. [Michael Conley] ***

PRINTER     output can be obtained by typing ' /L' at the end  of
	    the  command  line, provided that the WHEEL  byte  is
	    set.   The	program will expand tabs to  the  correct
	    number  of	spaces and will send a page  eject  (0CH)
	    after each 60 lines.
_________________________________________________________________

	       *** Changes for v1.3. [Michael Conley] ***

WHEEL	    byte implemented.  The Wheel byte location is equated
	    (set  to  03EH) and is checked before  the	following
	    restrictions  are tested.  If non-zero,  all  of  the
	    following tests are over-ridden.

MAXLIN	    is	implemented  (set to 80 lines now,  no	limit  if
	    wheel.)

NOTYP	    table  is included.  If a filetype is listed  in  the
	    NOTYP table, program refuses to type it. (.COM, .OVR,
	    etc...)

SYSTEM	    files are not typed unless wheel.

RESTRICTED  files (high bit set on second character of	filename)
	    are not typed.  This allows you to individually  pro-
	    tect a file without putting it into the NOTYP  table.
	    Same  bit  is tested by some versions  of  XMODEM  to
	    restrict downloading.

PAGINATION  can  be  defeated by typing ' /N' at the end  of  the
	    command line.  The program will then type the  entire
	    file (up to the limit of MAXLIN if no wheel)  without
	    breaking for the [more] prompt.

LUXTYP	    replacement.  The program makes an ideal  replacement
	    for  Luxtyp because its command structure allows  LUX
	    to call it without modification, thus enabling LUX to
	    type Crunched as well as Squeezed files.

	    INSTALLATION GUIDE FOR TYPELZ22


Beginning with the release of TYPELZ15, virtually all user-configurable
conditionals and values may be patched directly into the .COM file using
DDT or PATCH, or an equivalent program.

For convenience, each location is marked with a pointer, so that when the
file is displayed, the byte to change will be clearly indicated ... for
example the byte following:  [COLUMNS>	in the DDT or PATCH display would
be the one to change to adjust the number of columns on your CRT screen.

Here is a rundown of the user-alterable values and flags:


POINTER 	ADDRESS 	APPLICATION

MAXDRV+1>	10Dh		Highest accessible drive + 1 (A=2, B=3, etc)

MAXUSR+1>	118h		Highest accessible user + 1

MAXLINES>	123h		Max # of lines to display. 0 = no limit.

CRTLINES>	12Eh		# of lines on your screen

COLUMNS>	12Eh		# of columns on your screen

NEXTLN> 	141h-143h	After pause, up to 3 character choices to
			   display one additional line. L,l,(space)?
EJECTPG>	14Eh		send Form Feed to printer after # of lines.

WHLTEST>	158h		0 = NO Restrictions. 0FFh = Restricted except
			   for WHEEL users. (Wheel Address 03Eh)

NOTYPE> 	161h-188h	Table of entries for filetypes not to be
			   displayed.  Each MUST be 3 characters long,
			   and '?' characters are acceptable, function
			   as "wildcards" in the search.  Typical
			   entries should include non-text files, such
			   as COM OBJ LBR REL, etc...

End of user alterable area.

Note that the source code is included in the library and may be re-assembled
and linked, in the event the options here are insufficient for the application.
