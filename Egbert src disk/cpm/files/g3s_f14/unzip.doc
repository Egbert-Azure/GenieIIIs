
                        CP/M UNZIP v0.99

Usage:  UNZIP  <filename[.zip]>  [<afn>]

Extracts all members of the specified ZIPfile matching <afn>.
If <afn> is not present, a directory of the ZIPfile is displayed.

Examples:

UNZIP TEST *.*
  extracts all members of TEST.ZIP to the current drive.

UNZIP TEST
  displays a directory of the members of TEST.ZIP

-----
Good news:

1. Now extracts all files regardless of the compression method or
   version of PKZIP used to create the ZIP file.

2. Now also performs a full ZIPfile directory listing.

3. Extracts from SFX (self-extracting) .EXE type ZIPfiles.

4. Should perform all functions with no more than 46k of TPA.

Other news.

1. The program uses three (ugh) overlay files, one for each of the three
   possible main compression methods.  I had a single file version
   pretty much running, but was having problems with Aztec 'C's dynamic
   memory functions.  It should be possible (the memory allocation
   functions could be circumvented if necessary) but that version was
   nearing the practical TPA limit anyway.  The main problem with the
   overlays is not so much execution speed (an overlay is only called
   in once per file to be extracted) but is rather the inconvenience
   created by the limited ability of the compiled code to find its
   overlays.  This version pretty much has to be run from the same drive
   & user the overlays are located in (or they can be in the same user
   area of drive 'A').

2. The program still doesn't perform the 32-bit CRC check of the
   extracted file.  A thoughtful user just sent me some Z80 code to
   perform this function, but time pressures prevents me from
   incorporating this at the moment.  The same time constraints are
   preventing me from working further on other aspects of the program -
   the issues mentioned above as well as enhancements like non-
   extracting (typing/viewing) capability.  Hopefully I will be able to
   get back to some of this soon.

   The program does do as many internal validity checks as feasible of
   the file being processed.  Although I have every reason to believe
   the program is performing properly, the possibility of an incorrect
   extraction cannot be eliminated, so "standard disclaimers apply".  If
   anyone encounters any of the internal error messages, or has other
   problems or comments, please leave a message at the CRUNCH BBS at
   (201) 447-6543.
