# INITWE.MAC  and INITWG.MAC
This is a code written in Z80 assembly language. It appears to be a language-dependent part of a program called INITW, which is used for initializing a CP/M Ver 3 Hard Disk System.

`I N I T W G  *  C P M S Y S 5 b ( G E R M A N   V E R S I O N )`
`I N I T W G  *  C P M S Y S 5 b ( ENGLISH  V E R S I O N )`

The code contains a number of global labels and definitions for various ASCII control codes and prompts, as well as error messages and options for canceling or proceeding with the initialization process. There are also definitions for different types of disk drives, such as Winchester and floppy drives.
