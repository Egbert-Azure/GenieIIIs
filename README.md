TCS Trommeschl√§ger Genie IIIs

The Genie IIIs from Trommeschlaeger in Germany was still largely compatible with Tandy's TRS-80 systems, 
worked with either G-DOS, NEW-DOS or CP/M and shone with high-resolution graphics. 
With the fast-paced Z80 processor, the Genie IIIs was one of the fastest CP/M computers ever. 
The circuit board production for the Genie III was taken over by Siemens.

In this project we create versions for https://github.com/Egbert-Azure/sdltrs emulator from Jens Guenther
