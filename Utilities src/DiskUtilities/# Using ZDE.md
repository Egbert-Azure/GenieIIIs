# Using ZDE
## to modify `alias.cmd` and others

The editor is started with the command zde16 and can be run with a filename as an argument. If a filename is supplied, the editor will try to open it, if it doesn't exist then it will start a new file with the name supplied. ZDE uses the Wordstar key combinations which are explained in the ZDE documentation. On some machines the main command key CTRL+k is used as a cursor key, in which case ESC can be used instead. The most important commands are listed below:

Command Purpose
ESC h Bring up the command key help
CTRL+k q / ESC q Quit editor without saving
CTRL+k x / ESC x Exist and Save
CTRL+k l / ESC l Load a new file
CTRL+k s / ESC s Save the current file
CTRL+r Page up
CTRL+c Page down
CTRL+e / cursor Line up
CTRL+x / cursor Line down
CTRL+s / cursor Cursor left
CTRL+d / cursor Cursor right

ZDE is a great editor and well worth the time to learn. It has many facilities to make life easier for the programmer and will definitely help make your retro programming more productive.
