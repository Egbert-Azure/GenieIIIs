==========================================================================

     LANDER is a game which simulates landing a ship on a planet.  The
ship's fuel, speed, and height, as well as the gravity and the maximum
successful landing speed on the planet, are randomly determined at the
start of each game,   though they are weighted  according to the skill
level chosen.  In order of increasing difficulty the choices are:

               B        Beginner
               E        Expert
               N        Navigator
               A        Astronaut

      In  addition  to the usual  dangers of  running out of  fuel and
landing too quickly (also known as crashing),  a swarm of meteors will
occasionally get on a collision course with you.  If you do not change
your course enough by burning a sufficient amount of fuel,  each has a
20 % chance of hitting you.   Even if you do so,  10 % of the time one
of the rocks will stray and still hit you.

      This program  uses its own integer conversion  routines,  and so
will not 'bomb' if the amount of fuel is mistyped.  A simple <carriage
return> when the fuel is asked for is equivalent to '0'.
