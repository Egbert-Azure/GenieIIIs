
Option L -- Default library.  This option defines the default library name 
that LHC/LHQ will search for if none is given on the command line when the 
program is invoked.

Option E -- Library file type.  Specifies the file type or extension of the 
library.  In most cases, this will be "LBR."

Option N -- Default help file.  This option defines the help file name that 
LHC/LHQ will search for if none is specified.  This is the default for both 
the library member name and the stand-alone help file name.

Options D and A -- Alternate directories.  Define here the alternate named 
directory and alternate DU to be searched.  LHC/LHQ first searches the 
directory specified on the command line, (the current directory if none 
specified), for the requested help library or stand-alone help file.  If 
the file cannot be found, LHC/LHQ attempts to search for it in the named 
directory specified for option D.  If the system does not contain a 
directory with this name, then the DU defined by option A is searched.

Option P -- Printer check.  Specifies whether a printer-ready test will be 
made before printing.  If your system has trouble with the BIOS LISTST 
call, set this to OFF.
