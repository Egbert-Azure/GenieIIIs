     ZMP is a communications/file transfer program for CP/M which 
performs  Xmodem,  Xmodem-1k  (often erroneously called  Ymodem), 
true Ymodem and Zmodem file transfer protocols. 

     This   library  contains  an  un-installed  ZMP.COM  (called 
ZMPX.COM)   and  five  .OVR files.  There is  also a file  called 
ZMP-OVL.UPD  which describes the changes which need to be made to 
the user-written overlay to allow it to operate with this version
of ZMP. YOU need to read this one!!

     Details of changes made to this version are in the ZMPxx.NEW
file.
