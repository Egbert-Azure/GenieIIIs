This file contains the updated version of Bradford, Concom 
Enterprises' printer enhancement program which gives Epson, Gemini10x 
and other dot matrix printers NLQ type.  If your computer doesn't have 
enough memory to run BRADFORD.COM use BF2TNY.COM.  BF2TNY.COM takes up 
less memory; in return it limits you to 100 columns across the page.
