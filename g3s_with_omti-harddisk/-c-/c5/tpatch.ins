TURBO.COM

    Installation for patched Turbo Pascal (Herbert Oppmann 1/93)


!! ATTENTION !! Use this INS file only on Turbo Pascal Version 3.00A!
It doesn't replace the original Turbo Pascal installation program
(TINST.COM) but installs only the additional features added to Turbo
Pascal by my patch. Please read the documentation first!

		regarding the runtime library
		+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you do change here, I advise you to recompile the program CHAIN.COM,
so that your changes affect all your CHN files too.

line editor:
------------
What do you think of Turbo Pascal's built-in line editor? Nothing??
Then you can tell my patch to use the BDOS line editor function
instead!

Shall the BDOS function be used instead of the built-in one?

Terminal reset string:
----------------------
Is output at the end of the program, no matter why it stopped (normal
end, error, or user break). If you have choosen the BDOS line editor
and enter ^C at the beginning of the line, then this string is not
output.

Enter the string (max. 7 characters, empty if not needed)

Overlay files:
--------------
Overlay files of Turbo Pascal programs (that are the ones with
an extension of 000 to 099) are normally expected to be on the
current user on the drive that was specified with the OvrDrive
procedure. If nothing was specified, the current drive is used.
Now, with my patch, we do another try on an installable DU.
Only if we don't find the overlay file there, we give it up and
issue a runtime error F0 as usual.

Where should I try it?
Please enter drive (0= current, 1=A, .. 16=P)
1C96 E

And now the user (0 .. 31)
1C92 E


		regarding the editor/compiler
		+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

TURBO.MSG:
----------
You don't get asked anymore if you would like to load that file.
It is loaded everytime (if found) or never.

Shall the error message file be loaded?

TURBO.MSG,TURBO.OVR:
--------------------
The compiler searches these two files by concatenating "TURBO" with
the desired extension and searching the file with the resulting name
along a path (see below). But you may supply a DU here additionally,
so that the compiler first look there before looking on the current
DU. You should supply a DU here if these two files reside on a DU
but not where the COM files are, that are also searched along the
same path when you do "X" (eXecute).
And of course you have to enter a different name here if you changed it.

Please enter DU:FILENAME (no extension, max. 12 characters)
215C S20/0D


search path for TURBO.MSG/.OVR and COM files:
---------------------------------------------
Turbo first looks on the (supplied or) current DU, then on the DU that was
current when Turbo was started. If that fails too, then it does a last try
on an installable DU.

Please enter the drive (0= current, 1=A, .. 16=P)

And now the user (0 .. 31)
2E17 E

That's all!
