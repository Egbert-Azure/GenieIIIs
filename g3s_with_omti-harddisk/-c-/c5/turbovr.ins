TURBO.OVR

    Installation for new Turbo Pascal Overlay (Herbert Oppmann 1/93)


TURBO.COM:
----------
If you renamed this thing you have to enter the new name here, so
that it can be found from the overlay after the called program has
finished.

Please enter exactly 11 characters without DU in front and without
a point in between! (e.g. "MYTURBO COM")
01B8 SNE/0B


search path:
------------
The overlay searches for COM files first on the (supplied or) current
DU, then on the DU that was current when Turbo was started. If this
fails, it tries to find it on an installable DE.

Please enter the drive (0= current, 1=A, .. 16=P)
0285 E

And now the user (0 .. 31)
0283 E

That's all!
