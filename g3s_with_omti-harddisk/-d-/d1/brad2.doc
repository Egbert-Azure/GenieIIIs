INTRODUCTION
Greetings!  These are the instructions for version 2.0 of
Bradford, the printing program.  Bradford prints WordStar and 
ASCII files in very high quality, in a large variety of fonts
(typestyles).  It also allows you to give commands, either on 
the system command line or within your document, to control how 
your document will be printed.

This version of Bradford is far more versatile, and often much 
faster, than previous versions, so you might want to give it a 
look even if you've tried an earlier version of Bradford.

SETTING UP
Bradford works with three types of printers:
Type MX -- compatible with the Epson MX-80 or IBM Graphics Printer.
Type FX -- compatible with the Epson FX-80 or IBM Proprinter.
Type ST -- Star Gemini-10x and compatibles

There are three "configuration files" on your disk, one for each 
printer.  These files are called MX, FX, and ST.  There is also a 
file called CONFIG.BF.  You must take these two steps before 
using Bradford:
1) Rename the old CONFIG.BF to CONFIG.OLD
2) Rename your printer's configuration file to CONFIG.BF.

Now you are ready to use Bradford.  Use the command
     A> bradford braddemo
to print the demonstration file.  (Don't type the "A>".)

THE FONTS
There are many files on your disk that end in ".BF2".  These are 
the font files.  The part of the name before the ".BF2" is the 
name of the font.  Bradford reads one of these files in order to 
print in the corresponding font.

Notice that there's a font called "select".  Let's print the file 
called ASCII in the "select" font.
     A> bradford ascii .fnselect
Notice that we included a special Bradford command on the command 
line.  This told Bradford to read the new font before printing 
our document.  Bradford has a very large number of commands that 
can be used in this way.

PRINTING THIS FILE
If you want to use Bradford to print this instruction file, use 
this command at the system prompt:
     A> bradford brad2.doc .mo1 .dcc

PRINTING WORDSTAR FILES
Bradford has a special facility to print WordStar files.  Use
this command to print a WordStar file:
     A> bradford ws.bf myfile
Substitute the name of your file for the word "myfile".

USING BRADFORD COMMANDS
A command can be used in any of three ways:
(1) Put it on the command line after the name of your document, 
preceded by a period, as demonstrated above.
(2) Include it in your document, on a line by itself, preceded by 
a period.
(3) Include it in your document, within a line of text, preceded 
by a backslash (\) and followed by a space.
The file BRADDEMO demonstrates methods (2) and (3) of using 
commands.

PARTIAL LIST OF COMMANDS
Here's a list of some of the commands available with Bradford.  
If part of a command must be typed exactly as shown, we'll show 
it in capital letters.  If you should substitute your own 
information for part of a command, we'll show that part in lower-
case letters.  Remember that comands must be put on the command 
line preceded by a period, or in your document as described 
above.  See the file BRADDEMO for some examples of how to use 
commands.

MORE ABILITIES
If you decide that you wish to continue using Bradford after a 
reasonable trial period, you are expected to "register" your copy 
by purchasing a manual.  Additional features and abilities 
explained in the manual include:  print multiple copies, print 
selected range of pages, pause before each new page, high-speed 
draft mode, change spacing between characters, headers and 
footers, conditional and unconditional page breaks, a very 
thorough system of macros, changing the command characters, 
overstriking, custom configuration files, and page and chapter 
numbering.

IF YOU WISH TO ORDER A MANUAL
You can get the printed Bradford 2.0 manual (well over 50 pages 
of text) for $25, which includes postage.  It's a very well 
written manual, not full of hard-to-understand terminology.  Or 
get both the latest manual and the latest version of the disk(s)
for a total of $39.95.  Please send your check or money order
(in U.S. dollars) to:
     Concom Enterprises
     Post Office Box 5056
     Champaign, IL 61820, USA
Add $3 for air mail outside North America.
You may print the enclosed file "orderfrm.doc" for a convenient
order form.

ANY QUESTIONS
If Bradford seems to be severely malfunctioning, it's more likely
a problem with my explanation than with the program.  Please let 
me know if you can't get the program to work, and I will try to 
solve your problem.  You may ask me questions by mail or on the 
GEnie or CompuServe information services.  (My name is Aaron 
Contorer, and you can look up my electronic mail address on-
line.)

Technical support -- advice on how to get Bradford to do 
something in particular -- will be given only to registered 
Bradford 2.0 users (those who have purchased at least a manual).

BRADFORD 1 OWNERS
If you have purchased the manual for Bradford 1.20 or earlier, 
you are entitled to a $10 discount on one copy of Bradford 2 with 
manual.  Just enclose the original title page of your old manual 
with your order.  (Your order will also be checked against a 
database of registered Bradford 1 users.)  Thank you for your 
patronage; it is because of your support and kind correspondence 
that I decided to do this whole thing again.

BRADFONT AND UNFONT
These are programs for use in making your own font.  Use the command
     A> unfont fontname
to read the font file "fontname.bf2" and create the editable text file
"fontname.bff".  You can then edit this file with a text editor, and
turn it back into a font file with the command
     A> bradfont fontname
This process is explained in more detail in the manual.
