Introduction:

The CP/M Help File is in the Library to assist your on-line GEnie needs.
If you have any problems, please contact us through the CP/M Bulletin Board,
our regular scheduled RoundTable Conferences, or send GEmail to: CPM$ (just 
type 'S' at any GEnie System Prompt (?) and at the To: enter CPM$).  The
CPM$ is called a Group Mail address, and is sent to all of your CP/M SYSOPS.

This help file is divided into 3 main sections:
      1. Use of the Libraries, where you can upload and download files
      2. Use of the Bulletin Board for public messgaes, questions, etc.
      3. Real Time Conferences, interactive chatting and discussions.

        CP/M File Compression

     This document is intended to give a brief overview of files stored in the
CP/M RoundTable Software libraries.  For current information, see Category 4
of the Bulletin Board area. This file is an updated copy.

     Many of the files in the Software Libraries have been compressed and/or
grouped together in a single file by using one of the utilities available to
the public domain that either squeezes, crunches, libraries, or archives
files.  This has been done to minimize disk storage requirements and also to
minimize download time.

        File Tails Signify Compression

     These processed files are specially named with a filetype and can be
identified by the last 3 letters of a filename after the "." that signifies
the conversion.  These are:

 .ARK   for files archived (same as MS-DOS "ARC").
 .LBR   for library files.
 .?Q?   for squeezed files (middle letter is a Q).
 .?Z?   for crunched files (middle letter is a Z).

     A library is a group of files collected together into one file in such a
way that the individual files may be recovered intact.  A library file can be
identified by the "LBR" as the extent of the file name.  LU (Library Utility)
is a CP/M utility used to maintain libraries of files.  LU does not perform
any compression.  Because of this, most people will squeeze or crunch files
before adding them to a library if they want to save space.  If you want to
remove the component files (members) from a LBR file, you should have a copy
of LU310.COM, NULU152A.COM, or other LBR extractor utility.  (LU and NULU are
8080/8085/Z80 compatible.)

         ARKS
       Recently, popular CP/M Public Domain software files and information
files  are being distributed using ARCHIVE files.  Archive files are similar to
 library (LBR) files, in that they take a logical group of files and put them
together in a single file.  The main difference, is that the members of the
"ARC" or "ARK" file are automatically compressed.  The compression algorithm
chosen is one of three which will produce the smallest file.

     Archive files have been available to the MS-DOS and PC-DOS areas, and
been made useful in the CP/M environment with the introduction of the "UNARC"
program.  The current version is 1.6, and is available with extensive documen-
tation, and two executable COM files, a 8080/8085 version and a Z80 version.
The Z80 version takes advantage of the expanded Z80 (and equivalent) instruc-
tion set for speed and size, and therefore is machine dependent.  There is
also a modification overlay to adapt the program to non-standard CP/M 2.2 and
3.0 operating systems, such as CP/M68k and CP/M emulators.  Programs are
available on many machines to process "ARC" files, the Atari ST, systems run-
ning the UNIX, systems running MS-DOS, and CP/M. Please note that the CP/M ARK
is not compatible with most  Native Mode C-128 ARC.

     ARK11.ARK (file #7117) is the CP/M utility available to make an "ARK"
file. Archive files may also be made in the MS-DOS/PC-DOS or UNIX environment.
(ARKs made on other systems may produce different results as the CP/M ARK
program -- UNARC16 is able to extract and decompress these files.)
     To avoid confusion on RCP/Ms that support both MS-DOS and CP/M callers,
Archive files have a file extension of "ARK" for CP/M software and information
files.

          Details of File Compression

     Some files in the CP/M RoundTable Software Libraries have been com-
pressed, using one of the standard public domain utilities, to minimize down-
load time and to save storage space.

     USQ120.COM is used to unsqueeze, or expand files that have a "Q" as the
middle letter of the filetype.  Such files have been squeezed, or compressed
with SQ111.COM or similar utility.  These programs use Huffman Encoding to
reduce the size of the target file.  Depending on the distribution of data in
a file it can be reduced in size by 30% to 60% by squeezing it.  If you down-
load a file with a filetype indicating that it is squeezed, you will need
USQ120.COM to expand it before you can use it.  There are other programs
available, written in different languages and take advantage of special hard-
ware, but USQ120 is 8080/8085/Z80 compatible.

     Other utilities are available that have the unsqueeze coding imbedded and
function with squeezed or unsqueezed files.  There are programs that perform
file maintenance functions (NSWP), bi-directional display utilities (BISHOW),
and string search programs, (FYNDE and FINDU).  This method of compressing
files has been used for some time now and programs to uncompress the files are
available to several microprocessors and main frame computers.

     CRUNCH uses the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) techniques to compress files.
These "crunched" files are identified with a "Z" as the second character of
file type.  This method is fast and offers compression ratios around 55%.
Highest compression is achieved with graphics data, values of 90% are typical,
followed by text, with 50%, and COM files and other binary file of around 20%.
 See CRUNCH24.LBR for the Z80 CRUNCH and UNCRunch programs.  See FCRNCH11.LBR
for the 8080/8085 and V20 CRUNCH and UNCRunch programs.

     Since this method of compression is relatively new, there are only a few
utilities available that processes crunched files are "typer" utilities such
as TYPELZW, TYPEQZ, LT, and QL which also type members of libraries and
squeezed files.  If running a 8080/8085 processor, check the documentation to
determine if the utility will only process files on systems using the Z80
processor.  UNCR232.ARC contains a program to uncrunch files in the
MS-DOS/PC-DOS environment.

     MicroSoft BASIC programs are always saved as ASCII files.  (Saved with
the ",A" operand.)  They may than be squeezed or crunched.  This has been done
to allow them to be converted for use with other BASIC compilers without the
need to convert them with MBASIC first.

     Some executable files have a file extension of "OBJ".  These are really
"COM" files that have been renamed to "OBJ" to avoid execution on RCP/M sys-
tems.  Rename them back to "COM" for use them as commands on your system.

          So where are these Utilities?

     Below is a list of utilities in the CP/M software libraries that work
with the above mentioned files.  For the current version, check the directory
or look in Category 1 in the Bulletin Board area for any new information.

FCRNCH11.COM      5995  Uncruncher for 8080/8085 systems
UNARC16.COM       5997  Unarcer for Z80 processors
UNARCA16.COM      5993  Unarcer for 8080/8085 CP/M systems
UNCR24.COM        5998  Uncruncher for Z80 processors
USQ120.COM        5996  Unsqueezer for all CP/M systems
NULU152A.COM      5298  Library maintenance utility


Comming soon.... LZHUF (.?Y?)



Part II  Bulletin Board 
=======================


              GEnie's Bulletin Board--Quick Tutorial
              --------------------------------------

   So ya wanna get active in our BB area, but don't know how?  This file will
give you everything you need to know to jump right in.

DELETE CHARACTER
   Before you do ANYTHING, make SURE you have your delete character set
properly.  This will tell GEnie which key your computer uses to delete a
character.  Since you are using an Amiga, you want to use the Back Space key.
You need to set your delete character to 8. So, how do you do this?  At any
command prompt outside the BB, type 'SET'. Then pick option 3. Terminal
Settings.  Then ya pick 2. Terminal Settings.  This will give you a list of
various term options.  You want #3.  This should be set to 8.  After you set
it, you want to SAVE it with option 8 on the menu.  That's it, your set!

Remember, too, that you are calling a computer which does not accept your
cursor keys as editing commands <smile>.  There is a line editor provided for
errors and mistakes which you can no longer correct with your backspace key.
See your GEnie manual.


USING THE Bulletin Board
------------------------
   When you first enter the BB you are set for FULL MENU prompt.  That means
you get the menu at each prompt.  You will quickly get tired of it and want to
go into either BRIEF or NONE mode.  Easy enough.  Just type
PRO BRIEF or PRO NONE.  If you decide you want the FULL mode back, type PRO
FULL.  If you want even more information, type HELP at the B.B. prompt.

   Okay, you are here... If you have a special handle or nickname you like to
use, now is the time to set it.  Just type NAME. It will prompt you for a
Nickname.  This will be included with your MAIL name on every message you write
in the BB.
You can change your Nickname whenever you like in the BB.  Just type NAME
again.  But, all messages written while the old Nickname was set will still
have that name in their header.

Now, you have all these billions of messages in the BB that are marked as NEW
for you.  If you are made of money, or just ENJOY sitting for several days
reading old messages you can catch up to the current day by reading everything
(By typing BRO ALL).

           ===========   VERY    ==========      
           =========== IMPORTANT ==========
                        
Most dont want to do this.  That's what IGNORE is for. Typing IGNORE ALL at the
BB prompt will go through the BB and mark every message as OLD.  That way, when
you type BRO ALL (more on this later) you will only be shown those messages
written since you last read messages.  This only takes a few minutes!  Once
IGN ALL is completed, you may now use (with ease) the BRO and RAM commands!!!!

           =================================

After IGNORE ALL works...

You can still read the old messages whenever you want by using the READ
command.  It has its good points and its bad points.  We have, as of this
writing, 17 CATEGORIES of messages.  READ only works in one CAT at a time.
So... you will to type SET 1, SET 2 etc... after each READ to get to the next
CATEGORY.  This is only on READ, tho... the BRO command can cover the entire
BB. Anyway... You are new, and have typed IGNORE ALL.  BUT, you decide you want
to read all messages left in, say, the past week.  Easy enuf. When you are in
the CAT you want (Using the SET command) type:

READ ALL DATE>900210

This will show you every message in the current CAT written on or after 1990,
Feb 10.  The format for the DATE option is  YYMMDD.
So... 900210 means Feb 10, 1990.
Just do this in each CAT and you can read all messages left since Feb 10. The >
in the above command denotes GREAT THAN, or AFTER. If you wanted to read all
message BEFORE that date you would use <. You can also read all messages left
only on that date using = there.   Okay, now you are caught up with IGNORE ALL
and have read the past weeks messages using READ ALL DATE>900210 in each
CATEGORY.  Now, whenever you return to the BB all you have to type is BRO ALL
and you will be shown ALL new messages in ALL CATEGORIES since you last read
messages.

READ also works on TOPIC numbers.  Typing REA 5 will show you the entire
contents of TOPIC 5.  You can also read a certain message in a TOPIC using
READ.  Say you want to look at message (reply) 24 in TOPIC 5.
You would type:

  REA 5 24

You can give it a range of message #'s.  REA 5 24-30 will show you messages 24
to 30 in TOPIC 5.

WRITING A MESSAGE IN THE BB

   So you've read a message and you would like to reply to it...
Each CATAGORY is divided into message groups called TOPICS. A TOPIC is a thread
of messages all covering the same thing. To get a list of all the TOPICS in the
CATEGORY you are in, just type TOPIC.

Each topic has a title, and a descriptive header.  It also usually has a string
of REPLIES.  When you get to the bottom of all the REPLIES in a TOPIC you are
reading, you will be asked if you want to REPLY.  Type Y here if you do.  If
you dont want to reply, just hit <RETURN>.

Okay, you typed Y and want to leave a message.  You will get the prompt:
1>
That means you are on the first line of your message.  Start typing whatever
you want to say, hitting RETURN at the end of each line. When you are done with
the message, and made no mistakes that you want to fix, type *s to save it. You
can always type *h for help. See Survival Kit item #10 for a complete list and
examples of using the Bulletin Board editor's * commands.

Okay, now you know how to write a message, and fix any mistakes you might make
in it.  But, suppose you dont see a TOPIC in the CATEGORY that covers what you
want to say/ask?  No problem.  Just start your OWN TOPIC.
At the BB command prompt, or Reply prompt enter "START".

 ** NOTE **  The sysops and other members appreciate it a lot if you will leave
your new topic in the appropriate category!  <smile>  Use the SET command to
set to the category before you STArt a new topic.

 Back to STArting now...

You will be asked for a Title.  Enter a brief title about what you will be
talking about.  Then it will ask you for a few lines describing your TOPIC.
Enter them as desired, but remember, only the first 3 lines you type here will
be shown every time someone reads a reply in that TOPIC.
(If that didnt make sense, dont worry... Just remember to limit yourself to 3
lines here)
Once you save this (using the *s) you will be asked if you want to enter the
first message.  Type Y if you do, N if you dont.
Generally, you will type Y.  After all.. if you STARTed the TOPIC, you will
have something you want to say, yes?  Sometimes the 3 line Description will be
enough for you, maybe you just had a short question. In that case, you wouldn't
need to enter the first message, so you would type N when asked.

 **NOTE**  At a TOPIC REPly prompt you can read a message in that TOPIC again
by typing its number.  If you want to read Reply message 17 again, typing 17 at
this prompt will do it.

Well... That about covers everything you need to know to get started in GEnie's
CP/M Bulleten Board.


READ

   Everyone wants to READ, so let me explain a couple of things about the READ
command.  There are actually *2* read commands, one is CALLED READ and the
other is called BROWSE.

   BROwse is a shortcut command for READ NEW messages.  You can specify BRO CAT
and just see the messages in *that* category that are NEW or you can specify
BRO ALL and see *all* the new messages on the bulletin board in the categories
you are attending.  You *can* CANCELL a category and still use BRO ALL without
messages in that category being displayed to you until  you JOIN the cancelled
category again.

   READ is a command which works *only* in the discussion topics in the
category you are in.  There are several parameters of information, some
optional which you can specify.
   ALL of the new READ command options are listed in the HELP text that you get
when you type HELP at the Bulletin Board menu.  To see them, just specify HELP
READ, buffer it, its about a page of information, which you just might want to
print out and put in your GEnie manual.

   For the very basic, here is the structure of READ:

   READ 9 5-8 NOR
    :   :  :  :
    ->  :  :  :   --READ command, by itself prompts you for more info.
        -> :  :   --TOPIC # you wish to read *WITHIN* this category.
           -> :   --Message number or range of messages in the topic to read.
              ->  --Options, this is NOReply.  IE, its a complete message dump
                    which will not pause.  Other options include:
              NOT --no text, scans message headers only.
              AUT=BOB
                  --lists all messages within given READ parameters from mail
                     address BOB, and no others:
   READ ALL AUT=BOB will read all messages from me in the category you are
                    set to at the time.  This works on MAIL addresses only
                    and not nicknames.
              DAT>900210
                  --lists messages ONLY since the date specified. No spaces
                    in the command!!!
   READ ALL DAT>900210
                  --is the specific command that lets you view all messages
                    written in the category you are SET to after that date.
   READ 18 DAT>900210
                  --reads ONLY messages in topic 18 which were after Feb 10'90

   To continue reading after a specific date for other categories of interest,
just issue the SET command and enter the new category.  SET 2, SET 8, etc.

   These special read parameters work within a large topic, also for instance:

    READ 7 AUT=APPLE.CPM will show you only messages from APPLE.CPM in topic 7
                         of the current category.

   And remember, these things CAN be typed in all in one line or you can let
the bulletin board prompt your way thru them, regardless of your prompt mode.
I'd seriously suggest that once you are familiar with the looks of the bulletin
board, Buffer out a listing of CATEGORIES <these NEVER change>, a listing of
the menu <again, its the same>, and have them handy on a print out when you log
in!!   THEN set to PROmpt NONe!!!  <<smile!>>

   Judicious use of the IGNORE command can make topics, entire categories or
every topic and every category on the Bulletin Board appear as *OLD* messages
to you.  This will enable you to keep up with just the newest postings with the
BROwse command as described above.  Set to the category you want to
IGNore...remember, this marks all messages there as if you had read them.

   SET 2

   Then type in:

   IGN CAT

   You could also just ignore one topic in the CATegory:

   IGN 5

   Anything you IGNore is not lost forever, it just won't appear when you issue
a READ NEW command or a BRO ALL command.  You can still read and  search
through topics which have been ignored with the REA command as described above.

   Searching the topics on the Bulletin Board can save you some time, too.
There are two ways to do this.  The first command, INDEX, will give you a list
of EVERY single topic name on the BBoard.  Buffer and print out this list.

   There is a SEARCH command to help you find items. SEARCH will search through
the topic names <only> and match the characters you specify.  If you type in
SEARCH all by itself, the BBoard will prompt you for all additional
information.  First, it will want to know what search string you want.  This is
marked by slash marks at the beginning of the string and at the end:

   /MODEM/

   And then you'll need to indicate if you want ALL categories searched, or
just the one you are in currently.

   Once again, SEArch only searches throught TOPIC names, or SUBJECT lines of
the topics, but will match your desired string if it appears ANYWHERE within
the subject line.  For instance, /MODEM/ might bring up topics having to do
with XMODEM, YMODEM, MODEMS, HAYES, etc.


   There is a lot of powerful commands here-let them work for you!


How to Use the Message Editor
-----------------------------

You can change lines, insert, delete, and other commands here while you are
leaving a message.  The message editor is about the same as the editor in
GE-Mail.

First....all commands are preceded with an asterisk.  To see a list of  all
commands, at any line number in your message, as the first character, type: *H

You might want to buffer this list and print it out for future reference, in a
handy offline binder!!  It'll save you time in the long run!

Now, remember, before trying any command, the asterisk MUST be the first
character in the line.

The editor here is a LINE EDITOR.  This means you edit only one line at a time,
AFTER you enter it.  Each line is Entered into the system with a RETURN at the
end.  It is best to type up to around 80 characters and then press RETURN.

The most often used commands are CHANGE, DELETE and INSERT.  Lets take a quick
look at them first.

*CHA
====

 Here's the command to change a sequence of characters in a line.  You can
choose to have the line VERIFIED to you automatically by using the command:

*CHAV
=====

 The CHA command needs several arguments within the fields of the syntax:
 -* The LINE Number you want to edit
 -* The OLD STRING you want to correct
 -* The NEW String you want entered
 -* The number of times you want it corrected <<Usually one>>

The CHA command is followed by a single comma, the line number and then slashes
which separate all other fields of the line:

*CHAV,39/separaate/separate/1*
:  :  :  :         :        :
:  :  :  :         :        1 Time
:  :  :  :         NEW String
:  :  :  OLD String
:  :  Line #
:  Command <change with line verify on>
ASTERISK


*DEL
====

 The delete command is very simple....you type in the command, a comma and the
line number to delete:

*DEL,50
 You can also specify a range of lines:
*DEL,58-60

*I  <<Insert>>
==

 Insert allows you to add lines between previously typed text lines. You will
need to give it one piece of information, the line number of the text you want
your new lines to be entered after.  Lets say you want to add 3 lines of text
after line 5, you'd enter:

*I,5

Then you'd see line 6 come up, and you can enter text until you are done with
the information you wanted to add.  You are automatically placed in INSERT mode
as you enter each new line.  Exit INSERT with a RETURN on a blank line, and
you'll be placed back where you started in your message.

*L  <<List>>
==

 You can always LIST your message anytime you'd like, with the *L command.
Enter it as the first characters of any new line.  Without any additional
parameters, it will list the entire messae.  You can specify a range of lines,
too, tho, like this:

*L,80-86

Well, so much for B.B. Commands. Any other questions about the this, and any-
else, please holler!!!



Part III  Online Conferences
============================

Real Time Conferencing
In the CP/M RT  (Wednesday Nights at 10pm, eastern room #2)


You can type to other RoundTable members in the Conference area.  They will be
able to instantly respond to you and you can see what they are saying or doing
as it happens.  We call this the Real Time Conference.  Your messages will be
transmitted as soon as you press RETURN, and will appear on the screens of
everyone else in that "room". Split Screen terminal programs are best, and a
good one is Q-TERM.

Most of the conferences do not require formal protocols, but there are many
things you can do to make yourself understood a little better.  Follow these
quick tips for your first time on Conference.  You'll always get a notice when
you enter the RoundTable which announces how many people are on the Real Time
Conference area.  Sometimes there are none, other times we have a regular crowd
for specific nights and many times you can make or find impromptu discussions
and tutorials with fellow members.

First and foremost, remember that your line is NOT sent until you press RETURN.
 If you have a split screen or chat window, its very helpful to use that-see
your terminal program manual for instructions about that.
If you cannot use a split screen, and an incoming line splits up the line you
were typing on, don't worry.  GEnie still remembers what you ALREADY typed, you
can finish your sentence and press RETURN, and everything will be there, what
you typed before the incoming line and what you typed after it!

Many times you will want to type out a complete sentence or thought and need
more than one line to do it in.  If this happens, just place three periods at
the end of the line and press RETURN.  This indicates to those who are
attending the conference with you that you have MORE to say.
A single period at the end of a line indicates you have finished your thoughts.

Lines can be up to 250 characters long on GEnie's conference.  But, be aware
that when you type in something very very long that other people might be
waiting for you to respond with something.  It is many times much more  helpful
and courteous to other people to go ahead and break up a very very long line
like that into two or more lines, adding those three periods and a return
between each part:

<Bob> Hi George, How are you tonight?!  By the way, did you see the..
<Bob> incredible new PIPMAG File just uploaded to the Library?!


Abbreviations on Conference
---------------------------

Because people are people, they many times want to say a lot in as small a
space of time as they can.  Common abbreviations and phrases for people on
conferences follow:


Abbreviation    Meaning:
------------    ----------------------

Private Messages
----------------

Everyone has the capability of sending a private message to other people
attending the conference.  The way you can tell that you have received one is
that instead of just a <NAME> in front of the message, you will also see a Job
number:  like this:

<Bob> This is a real, public message.
<Bob> (Job 1) This is a private message, and only appears on YOUR screen!

       ^^^^^  See the (Job 1) in parenthesis?!  That means that it is private,
and came from the username on the line, who is job 1.  The Job number is
important because that is how you respond privately.  To send a reply, all you
have to type is:

/SEN 1 Got the message, Bob!

The NAM command is also important. This functions lets others know what your
'handle' is, instead of your GEMail address. Type /NAM BOB to display your
handle, along with your regular GEnie name:

<C.KENT> /NAM Clark

will now display as:

<[Clark] C.KENT>


PROCEDURES AND ETIQUETTE FOR FORMAL CONFERENCES
-----------------------------------------------

The RTC CO area (page 685;2) is used for several purposes, including: holding
formal and informal conferences, or just chatting with other members.  When the
meeting is strictly an informal one, there are no special rules, and
participants generally talk when they please.  However, for more formal
meetings, some rules must be established to keep the CO running smoothly and
give all a chance to participate.  This help file explains the general
procedures for running a formal conference in RTC CO area.

First, try to be in the designated room before the announced time of the CO.
Almost all of our COs begin at the time specified, and it helps a great deal if
people are there from the start.  Punctuality results in fewer interruptions,
and also fewer repeats of questions already asked.

Second, if someone comes late to the CO, it is impolite for that person to
break into the proceedings with a "Hi all, sorry I'm late!".  This almost
always results in a temporary halt while members exchange greetings, and wastes
the time and money of others who are there.

Third, wait for your turn to speak.  Typically, COs are held in two parts:  the
guest speaker (or the CO leader, if there is no guest), makes some opening
remarks or comments.  During this time, all CO attendees must remain quiet.
When the speaker is finished, there is a short break while the CO leader makes
a list of questioners.  Anyone who has a question to ask, or comment to make,
types in: /RAI  and that person's name is added to the list.  When the list is
complete, it is read back, and anyone who was missed the first time will be
added.  Please observe any limits on the number of questions that may be asked
at one time.  If there is a large turnout, members may be limited to 1 question
and 1 followup per turn, in order to give everyone his or her chance to talk.
Members who have more questions can always ask to be put on the list again for
the next round.

Fourth, when making your comments (or asking questions), use "..." at the end
of each line you type, to indicate there is more to come.   When you have
finished your question, type in GA (for Go Ahead), so the guest or CO leader
knows, and can respond.  When your turn is over, type in "G/A" so the next
person on the list can be called.

Fifth, it is best to stay in CO until your turn, because if you are called and
you are not there, your name will be crossed off the list, and the next person
will take your place.  If you come back after that, it is up to the CO leader
to decide whether or not to add your name back to the bottom of the list.

Sixth, remember that the CO leader, be it a SysOp or someone else, is in charge
of the conference.  If you have any problems or complaints with the way the CO
is being handled, wait until after the conference to straighten things out.
Rowdy or disruptive users will be gagged or even locked out of the RTC.

We have held many COs using the above rules, and the results have been very
good.  The conferences move smoothly, and everyone gets a chance to talk or ask
questions.  Courtesy and patience on the part of the audience goes a long way
to making a good CO.  If these guidelines are followed, a conference can be an
enjoyable and rewarding experience for all.

Here are some of the more used CO commands, and their explanations:

!! - entered when you have a comment on the current topic

/ECH - echo to sender on; it is helpful to come into our CO's in full duplex,
with a SplitScreen or window type terminal program so that your sentences are
not mixed in with others on your screen.
/EXI - leave the RTC; returns you to page 685
/MON 1 - Monitor or listen to what is being typed in room 1
/NAM Mark - add your name in RTC
/PRI 3 - go private with JOB 3
/RAI- get attention of leader
/ROO 3 - move to room 3
/SEN 2 Hello! - sends to job 2 a message m of "HELLO"
/STA - see users in room by name and location
/TIM - display time and day
/USE - see number of users
/XEC - exit the echo mode
/XMO - exit the monitor mode
/XPR - exit private mode

Real Time Conferencing is fun and informative!  Enjoy!
