                           version 3.0

                   A dBASEII(tm) Command File
                          By Jim Gronek
                           12/16/1987

        DB2SHELL  is  a  multi-purpose  program  written  in  the
dBASEII  applications language.   DB2SHELL provides most  of  the
capabilities of dBASE at the command level, and MANY capabilities
to enhance your utilization of dBASE,  all under a friendly menu-
driven  'shell' that provides constant feedback,  and control  of
activity.


        DB2SHELL  was initially derived from the excellent multi-
file set of database management routines included in DB2-CMD.LBR.
There were 41 separate command files,  taking up a minimum of 41K
on  any disk.  On my Hard Disk Kaypro 10,  the set occupied  over
168K, due to the 4K sector size on the disk.

        I  really  liked the concept of  an  all-in-one  database
utility  that  provides  a  more friendly  environment  than  the
standard DBASEII command level.  I didn't like the way it ate  up
space  on my disks,  or the way many of the user update  displays
were presented, hence, DB2SHELL.CMD.

        In its first iterations, DB2SHELL was little more than an
expanded and consolidated grouping of the DB2-CMD files.   Around
version 1.3,  DB2SHELL began to take on a life of its own, adding
many  significant  features  that  go  FAR  beyond  the  original
routines.   DB2SHELL  has  become a prime example of what can  be
created from the fruits of the Public Domain.  It is a collection
of techniques gleaned from many authors,  and is certainly beyond
the  capabilities  of  all but the most  experienced  of  dBASEII
programmers to fully understand.

        DB2SHELL  provides  all  of its capabilities in  only  11
files. DB2SHELL.CMD is the main program driver, to use just type

                    A>DBASE DB2SHELL<cr>.


        There are three files that YOU must modify to realize the
full capability of the program:

        SETPRINT.CMD  - A  command file  containing  the  control
codes for your printer.  Change whatever you need to, you may add
up  to  13  new memory variables,  but do not alter  any  of  the
existing  memory  variable names in SETPRINT.CMD if you  wish  to
maintain compatibility.

        APPLMENU.CMD  - A command file containing a list of  YOUR
DBASEII applications.  Use APPLMENU.CMD from this set of files as
an example.  The same cautions apply about memory variables names
here as SETPRINT.CMD.

        CLEARSEQ.CMD - A command file containing the CLEAR SCREEN
and CLEAR TO END-OF-LINE control sequences for your terminal.


            ================ NOTICE =================

        DB2SHELL.CMD  has  been encoded to improve its  speed  of
execution and reduce its physical size.  It CANNOT be listed,  or
modified externally.  Only the three support files, SETPRINT.CMD,
APPLMENU.CMD  and  CLEARSEQ.CMD need be  customized  anyway.

        The  program uses TEMPLATE.DBF for two of its  functions.
If  TEMPLATE.DBF  is not available  when  needed,  DB2SHELL  will
notify  you  of that fact,  and allow you to create it  from  the
menu.


        DB2SHELL.CMD  will  run  on any  computer  under  DBASEII
version  2.4  or 2.43*.  I doubt that it will execute  under  any
earlier version. Enjoy.

          ================ REVISIONS =================

        Version  1.1 allows default drives up to 'D',  instead of
'C',  and fixed a bug in display routine to allow viewing of last
record in database.

        Version  1.2 adds the ability to print a 'GRAPH'  of  the
database structure in use.

        Version 1.2KP has Kaypro 2/4/10 specific video codes.  It
may  also  run  on  other ADM-3A type  terminals,  but  I  cannot
guarantee success.

        Version  1.3 and 1.3KP have numerous coding  improvements
to  speed  execution,  and a bug in the 'compress'  function  was
repaired.

        Version 1.4 has numerous coding changes to improve error-
checking,  improve displays,  and speed execution.  Additionally,
version  1.4 incorporates routines from Adam B.  Green's book  on
Advanced dBASEII Programming that formats .CMD files for analysis
and documentation purposes.

        Version   1.5  has  improved  cosmetics,   controls   and
functions.  The date entered is now saved to disk as  SYSDATE.MEM
and  is  used to initialize the SET DATE function upon  entry  to
DB2SHELL.  The  system  date is also  validated  accurately.  The
command  file formatter will now process command lines containing
the continuation character (;).  Command files may also be output
with  or  without line numbers.  Menu items have  been  added  to
execute  any dBASE2 command file and to exit from DB2SHELL to any
CP/M  command  line.  The  most significant new  feature  is  the
addition  of  a menu item to create a MailMerge  compatible  file
from any dBASE II file.  The process is entirely menu driven  and
permits  selection  of fields to be included in the output  file.
Also  added screen and line clearing customization by means of  a
command file. Command file independence for applications has been
enhanced  by  saving  all  DB2SHELL  memory  variables  prior  to
invoking  application  command files,  and  restoring  them  upon
return.

        Version 1.6 restores the ability to run DB2SHELL from any
disk,  not  just  from A>.  Corrected a nesting bug in  the  CASE
portion of the command file formatter.

        Version  2.0 is a major rewrite of parts of the  program.
Some  of  the redundant options have  been  combined,  and  THREE
significant new capabilities have been added:

          1.  Menu selectable Directory Display.

          2.  The ability to 'type' an ASCII file to the console,
either squeezed or unsqueezed, even from within a library.

          3.   The  ability  to  purge  almost  any  database  of
duplicate records.

          Version 2.0 also has improved error checking and faster
response time to menu choices.


          Version   3.0  is  a  major  rewrite  of  the  program,
modifying many of the routines and splitting the program into  11
separate .CMD files.   The reason for the split is to incorporate
the  many  changes  and  to increase the  speed  of  response  to
keyboard commands.  Also, version 3.0 removes most (but not all!)
of the POKE statements that were driving MS/DOS users crazy.  3.0
may look like the same program as 2.0 to the casual users, but it
is not!


               ==== SOURCE CODE AVAILABILITY ====

        DB2SHELL is distributed as an encoded file.  It cannot be
listed  or  modified.  The modules for most of the functions  are
available in the original library DB2-CMD.LBR,  but those modules
have   been  'SIGNIFICANTLY'  modified  for  use   in   DB2SHELL.
Additionally,  DB2SHELL  incorporates certain techniques that may
be instructive for the dBASEII Applications Developer.

        Unencoded  source  code is available for $15.00,  if  you
pick it up from my RCP/M, or $25.00 on diskette through the U. S.
Mail.  Send  cash,  check  or money order to the  address  listed
below.  Cash  or money order purchases will be shipped within  48
hours of receipt. Allow 14 days for personal checks to clear.
