                     Z-Relocatable Flow Control Packages
                        11 October 89 by Carson Wilson

The seven pre-compiled Flow Control Packages (FCP's) in this library may be 
loaded directly to Z-System with NZCOM, Z3PLUS, or JetLDR, provided 
sufficient space has been allocated to the FCP segment.  The FCP's come in two 
flavors.  Files named FCP-nT.ZRL implement extended flow control processing 
when needed using a program named IF.COM at the root of your path, or at 
directory A0 if there is no path.  Files named simply FCP-n.ZRL rely 
exclusively on memory-based processing.  The "n" in the filename indicates the 
total number of records required by each package.  The standard number of 
records for both NZ-COM and Z3PLUS is currently 5, so if you wish to load a 
larger FCP you must reconfigure your system with MKZCM or by editing your .Z3P 
file.  FCP-5T.ZRL is the standard FCP module in both the NZ-COM and Z3PLUS
distributions.  For general help with flow control commands, see the file
IF.HLP or section 3.2.2 of your NZ-COM or Z3PLUS manual.

While IF.COM allows many options not available in memory-resident flow-control 
processing, fully resident versions free the user from the requirement that 
IF.COM be present during flow control processing.  Resident processing is also 
somewhat faster due to the need to load IF.COM from disk for each flow control 
command.  Finally, the ability to locate and load the transient IF.COM 
requires considerable code space in the resident code itself.  Generally, 
IF.COM is best used on fixed-disk systems, while resident processing is more 
suited to floppy-based systems.

The options included in fully resident versions were selected somewhat 
differently than for those using IF.COM.  Criteria, in order of precedence,
were as follows:

IF.COM Versions                       Resident Versions
---------------                       -----------------
1. Is the feature available in        1. How useful is the feature?         
   IF.COM?                            2. How much memory does the feature 
2. Does the feature require disk         require?
   access?
3. How useful is the feature?
4. How much memory does the feature
   require?

The tables below summarize the size and features of each flavor of FCP.  Each 
package includes only the features appearing above it.  For example, 
FCP-5T.ZRL (the default FCP for both NZ-COM and Z3PLUS) contains only ZIF, 
IFQ, OR, AND, negation, ERROR, and NULL.  Size is expressed as records plus 
remaining bytes required by the FCP.  As FCP space is allocated in record 
units only, I have attempted to include only combinations which leave as 
little remaining space possible.  Sizes without corresponding filenames are 
included for reference purposes only.
