Welcome to the Internet RoundTable, a most excellent place on GEnie!

Within the Internet RoundTable you will find discussions and files related to
the Internet, Usenet News, FTP (File Transfer Protocol), Electronic Mail, and
Networking, for all computing platforms.

The level of discussion will range from the beginner to the advanced levels,
and this is a great way to learn more with your fellow GEnie members.

The RoundTable consists of many parts:

* The BULLETIN BOARD contains many discussions about the Internet.
* The LIBRARY OF FILES contains many downloadable files including
  USENET News digests for many news groups.
* The CONFERENCE AREA is where people such as yourself attend
  TUTORIALS and question & answer sessions about the Internet.

In addition the menu shows options for ordering files and directories from the
various "anonymous FTP" servers on the Internet, and for requesting other
special services at standard GEnie connect-time rates.

If you have any questions please choose option 6 and leave us a message.

Your host sysop is Andy Finkenstadt, GE Mail address ANDY

We highly recommend choosing option 4 "About the RoundTable" and option 5
"RoundTable News" on your first visits.  The choose option 1 "Internet Bulletin
Board" to enter the discussion area.
