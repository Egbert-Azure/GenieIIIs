NOTEPAD DOCUMENTATION - by Steve Strommen, 12/31/83

ABSTRACT

NOTEPAD is designed to give you an easy way to create, modify,
store and print short notes to yourself with a minimum of effort. 
This documentation should help you get started using NOTEPAD
immediately.

Notes can be used to provide online documentation for other files
on a disk, or can be used just to jot down ideas or a things to
do list.  In any case, each note is up to 20 lines long, and a
directory is kept of all notes on a disk and the date that they
were last saved to disk.  Editing a note is very easy because all
four cursor keys and several control keys are defined.

OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS

Each time NP is run, you are prompted for the current date.  The
month, day and year should each be enterred as numbers, and the
year should be only the last two digits of the current year.

After the date is entered, a menu is displayed on which the
following selections appear:

F - Find a note.  This is used to retrieve a note from the disk
and display it on the screen for viewing, revision, or printing. 
You will be prompted for the name of the note, and your answer
must correspond with a note name in the directory (see D below). 
If the name you enter does not exist in the directory, a message
will say so.

N - Start a new note.  This is used to start editing a new note
that does not yet appear in the directory.  You will be prompted
for a name.  A default name is provided; it is the current date. 
After you provide the name, you get 20 blank lines on the screen
in which to write your note.

Z - Discard (zap) a note.  This removes the note from the
directory and from the diskette.  You will be prompted for a
name; if your answer is not in the directory, nothing will
happen. 

D - Display notebook contents.  This displays a list of names of
notes and the date they were saved to disk.  Pay attention to
which letters in a notename are uppercase and lowercase.  Help is
different from HELP is different from help.

R - Rename a note.  This renames a note on the diskette and in
the directory.  You will be prompted for a note name.

***IMPORTANT***

To terminate the program, you must press ESC while the main menu
is displayed.

***************

Several control keys are defined while NOTEPAD is editing a note.

1. Cursor keys:
   ctl-h: back one space
   ctl-j: down one line
   ctl-k: up one line
   ctl-l: forward one space

   ctl-a: to far left
   ctl-e: to far right
   ctl-t: to top
   ctl-b: to bottom
 
2. Insert and delete:
   DEL: delete previous character
   ctl-o: insert a blank line
   ctl-c: delete a line
   ctl-r: toggle insert mode on/off.  Note that insert mode is
     not very fast and may drop characters.  Also, there is no
     word wrap at the end of a line.  Normal mode is to overwrite.

3. Utility
   ctl-s: save note to disk with default file extension .TXT.
   ctl-p: print note to list device
   ESC:   return to the main menu - NOTE NOT SAVED
   RETURN: Cursor to beginning of next line

A NOTE ABOUT FILES

Notes are always stored on and read from the default disk. 
NOTEPAD itself need not be on the default disk, but it uses a
directory file called NOTE.DIR which is created on the default
disk if it is not already there.  It is recommended that notes
not be named with a disk prefix like b: because this could cause
confusion.  in
