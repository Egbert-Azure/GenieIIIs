If you decide that you wish to continue using Bradford after a
reasonable trial period, you are expected to "register" your copy
by purchasing a manual.  The manual explains how to use Bradford,
including many advanced features not explained elsewhere.

You can get the printed Bradford 2.0 manual (well over 50 pages
of text) for $25, which includes postage.  It's a very well
written manual, not full of hard-to-understand terminology.  Or
get both the latest manual and the latest version of the disk(s)
for a total of $39.95.
