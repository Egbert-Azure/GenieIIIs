Welcome to the Internet RoundTable, a most excellent place on GEnie!

Within the Internet RoundTable you will find discussions and files related to
the Internet, Usenet News, FTP (File Transfer Protocol), Electronic Mail, and
Networking, for all computing platforms.

The level of discussion will range from the beginner to the advanced levels,
and this is a great way to learn more with your fellow GEnie members.

The RoundTable consists of many parts:

* The BULLETIN BOARD contains many discussions about the Internet.
* The LIBRARY OF FILES contains many downloadable files including
  USENET News digests for many news groups.
* The CONFERENCE AREA is where people such as yourself attend
  TUTORIALS and question & answer sessions about the Internet.

In addition the menu shows options for ordering files and directories from the
various "anonymous FTP" servers on the Internet, and for requesting other
special services at standard GEnie connect-time rates.

If you have any questions please choose option 6 and leave us a message.

Your host sysop is Andy Finkenstadt, GE Mail address ANDY

We highly recommend choosing option 4 "About the RoundTable" and option 5
"RoundTable News" on your first visits.  The choose option 1 "Internet Bulletin
Board" to enter the discussion area.

Welcome to the CP/M RoundTable!
*******************************

For IMPORTANT information please use selection #4, About the RoundTable from
the main CP/M RoundTable menu at Page 685.

*********************************
   W E L C O M E   A B O A R D !
*********************************
Chances are this is your first time here so jump right in and feel out your new
message system.  Although you'll find that the menus are pretty straight
forward, let me offer FOUR pointers for using this system:

1) If you haven't recieved your manual, type MANUAL at the next GEnie prompt.
You may either DOWNLOAD the manual or ORDER a manual for delivery. There are
HELP FILES on most all the menus.  If a menu doesn't seem to have a HELP
option, try typing HELP anyway.

2) The real brawn of the CP/M RoundTable Bulletin Board is in the finely-tuned
Command Structure we use.  Commands may be selected either by entering the
corresponding number (found on the the Bulletin Board Full Prompt menu) - OR -
by typing the actual command.  Only the first three letters are actually
required.  You can mix any combination of command words and numbers.  You'll
want to become familiar with the BB Command Mode if you plan to actively
participate in the discussions.

3) To get here DIRECTLY when you logon to GEnie, add the following to the end
of your GEnie U#: ';685' (without the quotes). You can add a menu command to it
if you like -> 'XYZ#####,XXXXX;685,1' will automatically put you into the CP/M
RoundTable Bulletin Board every time you logon.

4) IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM -> At any menu page type 'PO' (which stands for POrt#.
 Hopefully it won't be used enough to win the obvious nickname!). Note the Port
and MRC number GEnie displays - and the time - then type FEEDBACK at any menu
page to report your problem.  Depending on the nature of your problem, you may
want to tell us the type of modem and software you are using.

You'll only see this bulletin just this one time, so if you have any problems
at all, don't by shy!  ASK!

Custom routines originally developed for use in REMIND and ZP fill
somewhat special purpose needs by doing things slightly differently
than the corresponding standard library routines or by providing
new services that I found useful and worth sharing.  Vers 1.6 adds
a new routine, ZMVDFN, that expands a ZCPR3 FCB du:fn.ft to a
memory buffer in a similar the way that ZPRDFN displays a ZCPR3
FCB du:fn.ft.  See JTHLIB16.HZP.
