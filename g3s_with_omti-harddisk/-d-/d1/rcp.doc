                                  RCP.LBR
         Library of Resident Command Packages for NZ-COM and Z3PLUS
                         11 Oct 89 by Carson Wilson


This library contains Z-Relocatable (.ZRL) Resident Command Packages (RCP's) 
which can be loaded directly from the library with NZCOM, Z3PLUS, or JetLDR.  
RCP-DFLT.ZRL is the default RCP for both NZ-COM and Z3PLUS.  The other RCP's
are named as follows:

RCP-nnxy.ZRL

where nn is memory required in records, x is either "F" for floppy-system 
oriented modules or "H" for hard- or RAM-disk oriented modules, and y is "C" 
if the CLED and SPOP commands are included (see RCPCLED.DOC).  Modules lacking 
a letter are the same for both series.

I hope that the sets of options I have selected will prove useful to you. 
For a much wider selection, look for RCPZRL11.LBR on Z-Nodes and other
bulletin boards across the country.  Those who wish to further customize
their RCPs should look for Z34RCP11.LBR, which contains the complete
source to the standard RCP.

Here are the names and features of the RCPs included in this library.  All 
commands appearing above the module name are included (e.g., RCP-09H.ZRL 
includes only H, CLS, R, SP, ECHO, POKE, and PEEK):
