;68     TRAPS FOR WARM BOOT and CONSOLE FUNCTIONS
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; This table allows you to replace certain BIOS functions with new ones in the
;       TPA.  Because of the banked nature of CP/M 3, simply changing the BIOS
;       vector could cause a problem as some BIOS functions need to be in the
;       system bank.  If you redirect any of these functions, you should replace
;       the first jump (0c3h) in each group with a LD HL, (21h).  When restoring
;       the jumps check first that the BIOS vectors you are restoring are in
;       fact to the BIOS and not to another redirection.  To do this, make sure
;       that the BIOS jumps are pointing above themselves, not down into TPA.

; For ZPM, the need for the traps has been eliminated.
;  Because pre-ZPM programs may attempt to write to the first byte of each
;  trap, these bytes can only be used for other things with some caution!
