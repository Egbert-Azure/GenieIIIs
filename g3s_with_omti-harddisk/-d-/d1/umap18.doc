What is that file doing in user 30?  I never use that directory!  
Where can I find a spare user area?  UMAP is a ZCPR3 utility that 
can display a brief map of a disk directory, showing which user 
areas have files and how many directory entries those files use.  
Or it can display a list of vacant user areas, users with no 
files.  In addition, it can display a brief summary of the total 
number of directory entries used, the number of entries still 
free, and the disk free space in kilobytes.

USAGE:

     UMAP {dir:} {{/}option}

Although a DU or DIR specification may be given, only the drive 
is significant.  If no drive is given, the current drive is 
assumed.

OPTIONS:  Only one command line option can be given.  It may be 
given with or without a slash and with or without a drive 
specification.  If more than one option is given, only the first 
will be observed.  Invalid options are ignored.

     U    Show complete directory statistics for each user area 
          on the disk that has active files.  User areas with no 
          files will be omitted from the display.  Although few 
          people will have files in more than a screenful of user 
          areas, if you have files in most of the 32 available 
          users, the display will be automatically paused 
          ("[more]") at the end of each screen.  The number of 
          screen lines is obtained automatically from the 
          environment.

     V    Show a list of vacant user areas (those with no active 
          files).  If all you're looking for is an empty 
          directory, there's no need to watch a list of user area 
          statistics scroll by, possibly taking up more than one 
          screen, and then have to try to figure out which users 
          are not listed.  With this option, only vacant user 
          areas will be listed.  Only two screen lines will be 
          used to display them, with users 0-15 on the first 
          line, 16-32 on the second.  If you only use 16 user 
          areas, you can ignore the second line.  For quick 
          referece, users with active files are represented by a 
          dot instead of a number.

With no options only total directory usage and free disk space is 
shown.

UMAP sets the ZCPR3 program error flag on error, but the only 
error currently recognized is an invalid (out of range) directory 
specification.

Large files require more than a single directory entry, so UMAP 
will display both the number of files and the number of directory 
entries they use.  It will also tell you how many free directory 
entries are left on the disk and the amount of remaining disk 
space in kilobytes.  The number of free directory entries will 
not be accurate if P2DOS datestamping is used.

CHECKING ALL DRIVES:  It has been suggested to me that UMAP have 
the ability to give user area statistics for a group of drives, 
one after the other, with screen paging.  While not a bad idea, 
implementing that mode would add significantly to program size, 
certainly making it larger than two kilobytes.  The limited 
usefulness of such a mode, I think, makes it not worth it.

However, a simple alias could accomplish the same thing:

     UMAP A:U;IF IN MORE?;FI;UMAP B:U;IF IN MORE?;FI;UMAP C:U...

This causes a simple page pause after each drive's usage is 
displayed.  Or, if you want to be able to abort the alias after 
any call to UMAP, put all the "FI"'s at the end:

     UMAP A:U;IF IN MORE?;UMAP B:U;IF IN MORE?;UMAP C:U...;FI;FI;...

If you have too many drives for a single alias, the last command 
could be a call a second alias.  Of course, there are more 
elaborate ways of doing this, but I'm not doing a tutorial on 
writing aliases here.

You might have noticed in the examples above that the option came 
right after the drive spec without an intervening space.  That 
works fine with UMAP.

CONFIGURATION:  UMAP can be configured to make either of the 
options the default mode of operation.  In that case either of 
the command-line options will turn the default mode off.  Do not 
configure UMAP to default to both options.  That won't work and 
you will lose access to the "no option" mode.

In addition, the vacant user area display can be configured as 
compacted to the left or spaced across the screen.

To configure UMAP use the accompanying UMAPnn.CFG file and ZCNFG. 
Do not change the name of the CFG file so that ZCNFG can find it, 
even if you use another name for UMAP.

HISTORY:

Version 1.8 -- October 10, 1991 -- Gene Pizzetta
     Howard Goldstein reported a stack problem when UMAP was run 
     under BYE.  The stack size has been increased to (hopefully) 
     solve the problem.  Also, replaced Z3LIB's PRTNAME with 
     GCOMNAM from ZSLIB, so disk name displays properly with GO 
     command.  A couple of minor display changes.

Version 1.7 -- April 20, 1991 -- Gene Pizzetta
     With U option, now shows directory name, if any, for each 
     user area, per a suggestion from Howard Schwartz.

Version 1.6 -- April 14, 1991 -- Gene Pizzetta
     Modified display of vacant users per a suggestion from Jay 
     Sage, which also resulted in simpler code.  A few other 
     display changes were made.  Added configuration byte for 
     extra space between vacant users.

Version 1.5 -- April 10, 1991 -- Howard Goldstein
     Cleaned up code.  No functional changes.

Version 1.4 -- March 27, 1991 -- Gene Pizzetta
     With V option, now prints only users 0-15 on first line, 
     users 16-31 on second line.

Version 1.3 -- March 26, 1991 -- Gene Pizzetta
     Minor changes in display for aesthetical considerations: 
     free entries and free space are printed on separate line.  
     At the suggestion of Rob Wood, added V option for vacant 
     user area display.  Added type 3 and type 4 assemblies.

Version 1.2 -- March 25, 1991 -- Gene Pizzetta
     Now re-initializes the drive byte in the FCB with a question 
     mark so UMAP will work with the GO command under ZRDOS.  It 
     seems that ZRDOS resets the byte to zero, for no known 
     reason.  Thanks to Rob Wood for discovering this 
     idiosyncrasy.  Added ability to count entries beyond user 
     31.  ZSDOS does not return them.  DRI's CP/M-Plus does.  
     It's there if it works on your system.

Version 1.1 -- February 23, 1991 -- Gene Pizzetta
     Added disk space display.  Removed VLIB routines to save a 
     lot of bytes.

Version 1.0 -- February 18, 1991 -- Gene Pizzetta
     Initial release.  The idea for this program came from 
     USRMAP, author unknown, and was written at the urging of 
     Howard Schwartz.
