	UZI	UTILITIES

This package contains several utilities to
manage UZI filesystems from a different host operating
system.  They have been compiled and used under CP/M
to build and repair UZI filesystems, and debug device drivers.
This has been useful because UZI was developed
and compiled under CP/M.  They have also
been used under SYS V Unix to debug the UZI filesystem
code (using a Unix file to serve as a virtual UZI device).

There are four programs, each contained in the C file of the same name:

MKFS: This makes a file system.	 It takes three arguments: a device
number, the total number of blocks, and the number of inodes.

FSCK: This checks file system consistency.  It takes a single argument,
the device number to check.

BD:	This dumps (in hex) a block of a device.  It takes two arguments:
the device number, and the block number to dump.

UCP: This is an interactive program taht performs a number of operations.
It can be used to make and delete directories and device files,
upload and download files between the host OS and the UZI filesystem,
list directories, and print files.  It takes a single argument, the
device number.  It then prompts for commands.  Look at the code for a
complete list of commands.

Each program is linked with the device drivers for your system,
some files from UZI itself, and some modified versions of other
UZI files (the ones beginning with "x").  The file "loadutil.sub"
shows what needs to be linked.  The files "filfs.sub" and "filflop.sub"
are examples of how these utilities are used to build and populate 
UZI filesystems.

The file UNIX.AZM is the source (in a obscure Z80 assembly language) for
a little program that opens the UZI binary image file, loads it
into memory, and starts it running from CP/M.

If you are trying to get UZI running on a new system, these programs
will be very helpful in getting your device drivers working, and
will allow UZI to have something on its disks when it finally runs.
