The  files which make up the XINU Operating System were typed  in 
from  the book:  Operating System Design,  The XINU Approach,  by 
Douglas Comer.   The Code is Copyright (c) 1984 by Bell Telephone 
Laboratories,  Incorporated.   All  rights reserved.  ISBN  0-13-
637539-1.   Originally designed for DEC LSI-11 computers,  it can 
be ported to any computer with moderate modifications.   The  TTY 
code  most  specifically.   While  developing the code  for  your 
computer,  it would be advantagious to use the printf from your C 
Compiler until all the code is debugged.  Your first project will 
be the context switcher and interupt handler,  which will have to 
be written in assembler.   This code is quite useless without the 
book,  so I would suspect that you will be ordering it.   If your 
interested in Operating System Design, it is quite an addition to 
your library.   Call Prentice Hall 1-201-767-5049 (Thru 5052) for 
current price and ordering.  Good Luck.
