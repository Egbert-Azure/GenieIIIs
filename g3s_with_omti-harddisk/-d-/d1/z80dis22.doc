Z80DIS22.DOC____________________________________________01_May_87


This  walk  through  the use of Z80DIS is taken  from  chapter	5
(page 35) of the larger Z80DIS manual.

			      - O -

Your first disassembly, a walk-through
--------------------------------------

The  purpose of this section is to walk you through a disassembly
using what I would consider the "best" first guess values for all
interactive program inputs.  I suggest using the widely available
public	domain	program D.COM for your first disassembly so  that
you may follow along with the example.

Z80DIS	is  a batch program with user interactive set-up  of  the
control  parameters.  Disk  scratch  files are	used  during  the
disassembly.  I suggest the following file disposition for a  two
disk  drive system:  (If you are not using D.COM then  substitute
your file name as required.)

     On drive A - Z80DIS.COM, Z80DIS.000, Z80DIS.001, Z80DIS.002
     On drive B - D.COM

During the Z80DIS set up phase direct files as follows -

     PRN to your list device (LST:) or to drive B
     Scratch file Z80DIS.$$$ to drive A.
     Initially suppress the MAC file by directing to NONE:

If  you have a third disk drive,  direct the scratch file to that
drive.

This optimizes data flow by minimizing disk head action.

The  following	assumes that you start with the A drive  as  your
selected default drive. Your CP/M input prompt should read:

			 A>

You  start  Z80DIS by typing "Z80DIS"  with  no  parameters.  The
program  will  prompt  you for inputs.	In  most  cases,  default
entries are shown in reduced intensity already occupying the data
field. If you type only the RETURN key, the default will be used.

INITIAL PARAMETER SETTING

After  a brief sign-on message,  you will be asked to supply  the
following information.

|================================================================
| Please enter	INPUT	file name: ______________
|		OUTPUT	file name: ______________
|		LISTING file name: ______________
|   Descriptive TITLE: __________________________________________
|
|	       file LOAD  address: ____ HEX
|	disassembly START address: ____ HEX
|	disassembly STOP  address: ____ HEX
|
| Do you wish to run a FULL output (as opposed to XREF only)?
| On which disk do you wish the scratch file to reside? (A-G)
|
| Do You wish to process all Z80 codes (as opposed 8080 subset)?
|
| Are all inputs OK so far?
|================================================================


Each  question is presented one-at-a-time from the  top.  Only	a
single suggested answer will be given for each. You actually have
lots of choices possible.  For details of the purpose,	defaults,
editing  capability   and error checking for each  answer  please
refer to the larger manual.

The following comments apply to all user inputs to Z80DIS:

File Names  - The  program  wants a CP/M style file name  in  the
     standard form D:FILENAME.EXT.  Each file name,  but the very
     first, has default values selected to simplify your job.

Letter	Case  - Upper and lower case letters are  equivalent  and
     will echo as upper case.

Editing Your Input - All inputs,  except single character Y or	N
     answers,  must  be terminated by a carriage return (shown as
     <CR>).   Until the <CR> terminator is typed, you may correct
     the  entry  as required by backspacing.

Terminating  Z80DIS  - You  may terminate  Z80DIS  by  the  usual
     control-C	(shown	as ^C) at any time.  At later  stages  of
     execution,  only  the then current phase will be aborted  to
     provide  a graceful recovery of the processing done to  that
     point.

Notation  - In	the  examples  to  follow,   carriage  return  is
     sometimes indicated by the notation <cr>.

Z80DIS22.DOC____________________________________________01_May_87


-----------------------------------------------------------------
INPUT file name: ______________

     Type  the name of your binary file to be disassembled.  As I
have suggested placing this file on the B drive,  you will need a
B: drive prefix.  The program will default the file extension  to

	       b:d<cr>

The program will echo:

	       B:D.COM

-----------------------------------------------------------------
OUTPUT file name: ______________

     Z80DIS  will  show  the  default  in  reduced  intensity  as
NONE:.MAC.   Simply type carriage return (<cr>). The program will
echo:
	       NONE:

This will suppress generation of the D.MAC assembly code file.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
LISTING file name: ______________

     Z80DIS  will  show  the  default  in  reduced  intensity  as
B:D.PRN.  I suggest that you change this to direct printer output
by typing:
	       lst:<cr>

The program will echo:

	       LST:

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Descriptive TITLE: __________________________________________

     Type  the	date and time of your disassembly followed  by	a
carriage return.  The program will not interpret your input.  For
the example, I typed:

	       Demonstration<cr>

-----------------------------------------------------------------
file LOAD  address: ____ HEX

     Accept  the  default value ( 0100 hex) by typing a  carriage
return.

-----------------------------------------------------------------






				4





Z80DIS22.DOC____________________________________________01_May_87


disassembly START address: ____ HEX

     Accept the default value ( 0100 hex) by carriage return.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
disassembly STOP  address: ____ HEX

     Accept the default value by carriage return.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Do you wish to run a FULL output
      (as opposed to XREF only) ? (Y/N) _

     Type  Y  to select the full output.  No carriage  return  is
needed. Only four characters are accepted for input: y Y n N. All
others are ignored and the program will beep your terminal "bell"
to indicate bad input.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
On which disk do you wish the scratch file to reside? (A-G) _

     Type <cr> to accept the default (A:) drive.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Do you wish to process all Z80 codes
      (as opposed 8080 subset only) ? (Y/N) _

     As D.COM is an older 8080 CP/M program you should type N. If
your program is known to contain Z80 instructions, type Y.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Are all inputs OK so far? (Y/N) _

     If all looks OK,  type Y.	A no (N) response will return you
to the first question again.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Z80DIS22.DOC____________________________________________01_May_87


BREAK TABLE BUILDING

After  you  have answered Y (yes) to the "Inputs  OK?"	question,
the  screen  will  clear and your terminal will now  display  the
following:

|================================================================
| >>>  Z80DIS version 2.2
| You may now enter CONTROL BREAK addresses to define the type
|  of disassembly for each section of the code; each control
|  break defines the first address of a section which ends at the
|  beginning of the next section-1 byte.
|
| NOTE: You may select AUTOMATIC CONTROL BREAK assignment by the
|	artificial intelligence expertise of Z80DIS by typing *
|
| TO SEE DETAILS OF YOUR COMMAND CHOICES, type H
|
| ?: _
|================================================================

A  break  table tells a disassembler how to interpret the  binary
bytes that it is examining.  A disassembler must know whether the
bytes are instructions or data in order to proceed.

First type the letter H just to see your choices.  Then type  the
character  *  to select automatic break table  operation.  Z80DIS
will ask for confirmation:  Type Y to confirm.

The  *	command  will generate the break  table  for  you.  After
automatic assignment returns,  you will be shown the break table.
You may list the table to your printer if you wish by typing P.

If Z80DIS had trouble reaching a decision about some of the code,
anomaly  reports  will	be displayed and you  will  be	given  an
opportunity  to print these reports.  I got one message with  the
version  of  D.COM that I was running.	Note that D.COM  replaces
itself nearly every time you run it,  and your copy will  contain
different file names in the directory part.

Just  for now,	print any anomalies if you wish then  proceed  to
exit the break defining process.

To  exit  the break table building process enter  the  Q  command
(Quit).  As you have not saved a copy of the changed break  table
to  a file,  Z80DIS will ask you to either save the file or  type
the  quit  command  again.   Type  Q  a  second  time  to   start
disassembly.

DISASSEMBLY PASS ONE

As  the  disassembly begins the code is cracked according to  the
break  table,  the cross reference list structure is linked  into
the PASCAL heap space in upper memory, the cracked code is copied
with  context information onto a scratch file called  Z80DIS.$$$.
During pass one, your console screen will display the following:

|================================================================
| Beginning disassembly...
| THIS IS Pass 1
| working at 05F0 Asc
|================================================================

The  "working  at"  line is animated and will  show  the  current
address and disassembly mode. In the illustrated case the program
has  just  finished processing the file D.COM and the last  break
type was ascii.

			       --


DISASSEMBLY PASS TWO

During	the  second pass all user output files and  listings  are
produced  and the scratch file is erased.  During pass two,  your
console screen will display the following:

|================================================================
| THIS IS Pass 2
| scratch file contains 396 records of 30 bytes each
| Free memory space remaining after XREF table storage
|   assignments is 29144 bytes out of the original 31300
|   bytes (or	6.9 percent used.)
|
| LISTING cross references
|
| LISTING Subroutines
|
| PRODUCING disassembled output files
|   Processing external label equates
|   Working at 05F0 Asc
|================================================================

The informative messages about file and memory space will let you
see just how close to capacity the program is running.

During this pass your printer will start to print the output.

The  "working  at"  line is animated and will  show  the  current
address and disassembly mode. In the illustrated case the program
has  just  finished pass two processing of the file D.COM.

When  the  program is complete,  Z80DIS will ring  your  terminal
"bell" twice and display the following sign-off message:

This  section is taken from Appendix A of the Z80DIS user  manual
(page 43).

			      - O -

Installation of Z80DIS for your computer
----------------------------------------

CP/M  is  a generic operating system,  but most of the	terminals
used  with  CP/M have features not  anticipated  by  CP/M.  These
features  include  CURSOR  ADDRESSing and BRIGHT/DIM  display  of
characters.  This program utilizes such features, when available,
to  improve the operator interaction.	As the program itself  is
written  in TURBO PASCAL,  the TURBO installation support feature
has been used to make this adaptation easy.

Therefore,  before you use this program,  it must be installed to
your  particular  terminal,  by  providing  it	with  information
regarding control characters required for certain functions. This
installation is easily performed using the program ZDINSTAL which
is described in this section.

The following files are part of this program installation package
and  must  be  present during terminal	installation  (the  three
ZDINSTAL.*  files  may then be deleted after installation  if  no
other terminals are to be supported)..

     Z80DIS.COM    - Z80DIS main program file
     Z80DIS.000    - overlay file
     Z80DIS.001    - overlay file
     Z80DIS.002    - overlay file

     ZDINSTAL.COM  - the installation program
     ZDINSTAL.MSG  - text of ZDINSTAL messages
     ZDINSTAL.DTA  - terminal characteristics data



- THE INSTALLATION PROCEDURE -


Start  the  installation of Z80DIS by typing "ZDINSTAL"  at  your
terminal. Select Screen installation from the main menu.

A  numbered  menu listing a collection of popular terminals  will
appear, inviting you to choose one by entering its number.

If your terminal is mentioned,	just enter the corresponding num-
ber,  and  the installation is complete.  Before installation  is
actually performed, you are asked the question..


     Do you want to modify the definition before installation? _




				9





Z80DIS22.DOC____________________________________________01_May_87


This allows you to modify one or more of the values being instal-
led  as described in the following.  If you do not want to modify
the terminal definition,  just type N,	and the installation will
complete  by  asking you the operating frequency of your  CPU  to
establish parameters for timing loops.

If your terminal is not on the menu, however, you must define the
required values yourself.  The values can most probably be  found
in the manual supplied with your terminal.

Enter  the  number corresponding to None of the above and  answer
the questions one by one as they appear on the screen.

In  the following,  each command you may install is described  in
detail.  Your terminal may not support all the commands that  can
be installed. If so, just bypass the command not needed by typing
<CR> in response to the prompt.  If Delete line,  Insert line, or
Erase  to  end	of line is not installed,  the function  will  be
emulated in software, slowing screen performance somewhat.

Commands may be entered either simply by pressing the appropriate
keys or by entering the decimal or hexadecimal ASCII value of the
command.  If a command requires the two characters <ESC> (escape)
and = (equal), you may
			     either

     Press  first  the Esc key,  then the =.  The entry  will  be
echoed with appropriate labels, i.e. <ESC> =.

			       or

     Enter the decimal or hexadecimal values separated by spaces.
Hexadecimal values must be preceded by a dollar-sign.  Enter e.g.
27 61  or  $1B 61  or  $1B $3D	which are all equivalent.

The two methods cannot be mixed in the same definition, i.e. once
you  have  entered  a non-numeric character,  the  rest  of  that
command must be defined in that mode, and vise versa.

A  -  (hyphen)	entered as the very first character  is  used  to
delete a command, and the text Nothing to be echoed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Terminal type: _

     Enter  the  name of the terminal you are about  to  install.
When  you complete ZDINSTAL,  the values will be stored,  and the
terminal  name will appear on the initial list of  terminals.  If
you later need to re-install Z80DIS to this terminal,  you can do
that by choosing it from the list.

-----------------------------------------------------------------





			       10





Z80DIS22.DOC____________________________________________01_May_87


Send an initialization string to the terminal? _

     If  you want to initialize your terminal when Z80DIS  starts
(e.g.  to download commands to programmable function  keys),  you
answer Y for yes to this question. If not, just hit <CR>.

     If you answer Y, you may choose between entering the command
directly  or defining a file name containing the command  string.
The  latter is a good idea if the initialization string is  long,
as a string to program a number of function keys would be.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Send a reset string to the terminal? _

     Here,  you  may  define a string to be sent to the  terminal
when Z80DIS terminates.  The above description of the initializa-
tion command applies here.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
CURSOR LEAD-IN command: _

     Cursor  Lead-in  is a special sequence of	characters  which
tells  your terminal that the following characters are an address
on the screen on which the cursor should be placed.

     When  you define this command,  you are asked the	following
supplementary questions:

CURSOR POSITIONING command to send between line and column: _

     Some terminals need a command between the two numbers  defi-
ning the row and column cursor address.

CURSOR POSITIONING command to send after line and column: _

     Some terminals need a command after the two numbers defining
the row and column cursor address.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Column first? _

     Most terminals require the address in the format: first ROW,
then COLUMN.  If this is the case on your terminal,  answer N. If
your terminal wants COLUMN first, then ROW, then answer Y.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
OFFSET to add to LINE _

     Enter the number to add to the LINE (ROW) address.

-----------------------------------------------------------------






			       11





Z80DIS22.DOC____________________________________________01_May_87


OFFSET to add to COLUMN _

     Enter the number to add to the COLUMN address.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Binary address? _

     Most  terminals need the cursor address sent in binary form.
If  that is true for your terminal,  enter Y.  If  your  terminal
expects the cursor address as ASCII digits,  enter N.  If so, you
are asked the supplementary question..

2 or 3 ASCII digits? _

     Enter the number of digits in the cursor address for    your
terminal.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
CLEAR SCREEN command: _

     Enter  the  command that will clear the entire  contents  of
your screen,  both foreground and background,  if applicable.  If
you have no command to clear the screen, enter - (hyphen).

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Does CLEAR SCREEN also HOME cursor? _

     This is normally the case; if it is not so on your terminal,
enter N, and define the cursor HOME command.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
DELETE LINE command: _

     Enter the command that deletes the entire line at the cursor
position.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
INSERT LINE command: _

     Enter  the  command that inserts a line at the cursor  posi-
tion.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
ERASE TO END OF LINE command: _

     Enter  the command that erases the line at the cursor  posi-
tion from the cursor position through the right end of the line.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
START OF 'LOW VIDEO' command: _

     If your terminal supports different video intensities,  then
define	the command that initiates the DIM video  here.  If  this
command is defined, the following question is asked:



			       12





Z80DIS22.DOC____________________________________________01_May_87


START OF 'NORMAL VIDEO' command: _

     Define  the command that sets the screen to show  characters
in 'normal' video.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Number of rows (lines) on your screen: _

     Enter the number of horizontal lines on your screen.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Number of columns on your screen: _

     Enter the number of column positions on your screen.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Delay after CURSOR ADDRESS (0-255 ms): _
Delay after CLEAR, DELETE, and INSERT (0-255 ms): _
Delay after ERASE TO END OF LINE and HIGHLIGHT On/Off (0-255 ms):


     Enter the delay in milliseconds required after the functions
specified. <CR> means 0 (no delay).

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Is this definition correct? _

     If you have made any errors in the definitions, enter N. You
will then return to the terminal selection menu. The installation
data  you have just entered will be included in the  installation
data file and appear on the terminal selection menu,  but instal-
lation will not be performed.

     When  you	enter  Y in response to this  question,  you  are
asked..

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Operating frequency of your microprocessor in MHz (for delays): _

     As  the  delays  specified  earlier  are  depending  on  the
operating frequency of your CPU,  you must define this value.  If
your  processor  operates at a fractional speed (i.e.  2.5  Mhz),
enter the next larger integer value (3 Mhz for this example.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------


The  installation is finished,	installation data is  written  to
Z80DIS,  and you return to the outer menu.  New installation data
is also saved in the installation data file, and the new terminal
will  appear on the terminal selection list when you run ZDINSTAL
in the future.

Z80DIS22.DOC____________________________________________01_May_87


Significant Changes in Version 2.2		Released 05/01/87
----------------------------------

A. Format Improvements

     1) Output format changes for M80 compatibility:
	  Singular references now flagged with $ not #
	  Inferred references flagged with ?
	  No : (colon) on labels on EQU statements
	  No address on END card
	  Shortened some comments to fit on M80 list page
	  Output M80 pseudo-op '.Z80' just before 'ORG' line

     2) Comments showing Reference-type on EQU external lines are
     now preceded by a semi-colon (;).

     3) Lower-case 'end' operation changed to upper-case 'END'.

     4)  Z80DIS now remembers the numeric value on any	immediate
     load of the C register:
	       LD      C,nn
     When 'nn' is in the range 0..40 hex, the value is translated
     and shown on the following BDOS call as a CP/M function.
	       CALL    BDOS	 ; fcnNN= XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

     5)  DEFS  pseudo op now modified to  specify  filling  value
     found in the region. i.e.
	       DEFS 1234H,00H
     When  automatic assignment has set the break table,  this is
     the right thing to do because the space area is known to  be
     filled with only a single value throughout. That is not true
     for  a user supplied SPC break but the DEFS is still  output
     as if it was true.

     6)  Changed format of DEFB print out to try to eliminate the
     alternation of long and short lines.  Also changed automatic
     break  table handling of ASCII data to better  resynchronize
     text  lines  with	the labeled  bytes.  These  are  esthetic
     improvements.

B. Bug Fixes

     1)  Fixed bug causing occasional truncation of default  file
     name generated for break table save or load.

     2) Changed two remaining cases of incorrect address compares
     to use the correct 16-bit unsigned compare function.

     3) Fixed bug when size of SPC blocks get larger than biggest
     positive integer.

     4) Fixed bug causing early termination under certain obscure
     circumstances  involving  interactions with zero filled  SPC
     regions.



			       14





Z80DIS22.DOC____________________________________________01_May_87


     5) Address table conversion (break type ADT) was modified to
     change format of output from
	       DEFW (xxxx)   to
	       DEFW xxxx

C. Algorithm & Heuristic Improvements

     1)  Added	new controls on recognition of	ASCII  text.  Now
     check  further into string composition for number of  common
     punctuation  characters and for number of	rare  punctuation
     characters in the string. If excessive, then not ASCII.

     2)  Improved  distinction	between strong and  weak  address
     references  to converge the automatic break assignment  with
     fewer passes over the code.

D. Speed-ups and memory savings

     1)  Cross Reference Information moved out of real memory  to
     virtual memory on a disk file.

     2)  Label table records reduced in size by eliminating  XREF
     linkage pointers.



Significant Changes in Version 2.1		Released 01/12/86
----------------------------------

     1) BUG CORRECTION:  During automatic break table creation in
version 2.0,  the codes DD34,  DD35,  DD36, FD34, FD35, FD36 were
not  correctly	recognized.  This resulted in  false  assumptions
about  the  legality  of some Z80 code regions	which  were  then
thought to be data regions rather than instruction regions.  This
has been corrected in version 2.1.

     2) IMPROVEMENT IN HANDLING JR REFERENCES:	In  disassembling
8080  coding,  instruction jumps and calls use 3-byte addressing;
that is unambiguous and not easily misinterpreted. With Z80 code,
ASCII text blocks contain codes that are easily mistaken for  Z80
relative  jumps;  that	creates apparent jump references to  code
within	128 bytes before or after the  misinterpreted  byte.  The
ASCII blank (20 hex) is especially bad as it looks exactly like a
"JR NZ,xxxx" code. Version 2.1 has been much improved to distrust
relative  jump references as a basis for declaring a region to be
instructions.  Version	2.1  examines corroborative  evidence  to
distinguish ASCII data from instruction codes.

     3) OTHER IMPROVEMENTS:  The entire Expert system  comprising
the Automatic Break Determination feature was enhanced to yield a
more complete analysis of the code structure.






			       15





Z80DIS22.DOC____________________________________________01_May_87


Highlights of Changes in Version 2.0		Released 12/01/85
------------------------------------

     1) AUTOMATIC BREAK TABLE CREATION: When the program asks for
break  table inputs,  you may now enter '*' which will trigger	a
detailed analysis of the structure and relationships of the input
code.

     2)  The COM file and overlay files for Z80DIS no longer need
to be on your default disk drive.

     3)  The  cross-reference listing now shows the  break  table
region of residency for each label.
