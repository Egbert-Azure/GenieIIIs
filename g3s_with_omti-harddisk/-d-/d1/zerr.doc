ZERR INFORMATION:

ZERR  is  a simple error handler derived from EASE 1.6z  by  Paul 
Pomerleau.   When  a  program signals ZCPR to  invoke  the  error 
handler, ZERR prints an informative message describing the  error 
and  presents  the bad command for editing.  The  user  can  then 
cancel, skip (in a multiple command line), or fix the command.

Note  that  many programs set the program error  flag,  which  is 
tested  by IF ER, but do not invoke an error handler.  The  error 
handler is only useful when the command line can be corrected  to 
solve  the problem.  For example, attempting to assemble  a  non-
existent  file should invoke the error handler, but  an  assembly 
error should set the error flag.

Z34RCP11,  Carson Wilson's update of the RCP, has the ability  to 
signal  the  error handler to invoke a transient command  of  the 
same  name  as  a resident command which has  just  failed.    In 
that case, the error handler just passes the command line back to 
ZCPR   with  a  prefixed  ":" (or  whatever  you  install).   For 
example, the resident CP command cannot handle an ambiguous  file 
spec, but the more powerful transient program will.  

ZERINS16 installs  the  control  key  set  for  the  editor   and 
configures a few options.
