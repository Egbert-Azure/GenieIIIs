	OTHELLO IS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR GAMES AROUND TODAY.
THE EXCITEMENT IS CERTAINLY JUSTIFIED, SINCE OTHELLO IS AN EXCELLENT
GAME. OTHELLO SWEPT JAPAN AND IS NOW MAKING A COMMERCIAL SWEEP HERE.
HOWEVER, THE BASIC CONCEPTS OF THE GAME HAVE BEEN AROUND SINCE THE
VICTORIAN TIMES IN ENGLAND WHERE IT WAS CALLED REVERSI. 
	THE GAME OTHELLO / REVERSI IS A VERY SIMPLE, ELEGANT ONE,
WHICH PERMITS MUCH OPPORTUNITY FOR STRATEGY. THE GAME IS PLAYED ON AN
8 BY 8 MATRIX, AND EACH PLAYER HAS 32 PLAYING DISKS, WHICH ARE WHITE
ON ONE SIDE AND BLACK ON THE OTHER (REPRESENTED IN THE COMPUTER
VERSION BY 'X' AND 'O' RESPECTIVELY). ONE PLAYER PLAYS 'O' (COMPUTER)
AND THE OTHER PLAYS 'X' (HUMAN). FOUR STARTER PIECES ARE PLACED IN
THE CENTER OF THE BOARD TO BEGIN PLAY (EXCEPT WHEN A HANDICAP IS
GIVEN BY EITHER YOU OR THE COMPUTER. IN THIS CASE THE CORNER SPACES
ARE GIVEN TO THE PERSON RECEIVING THE HANDICAP [ BUT BEWARE!!! THERE
IS A 25% PROBABILITY THAT ANY ONE HANDICAP PIECE MAY BE PLACED
RANDOMLY ON THE BOARD]. FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU GIVE THE COMPUTER A
HANDICAP OF 3 [WHICH WOULD BE DONE BY ENTERING A RANK OF 8, RANK 5
IS DEAD EVEN] , THREE CORNERS WOULD BECOME'O''S AT THE START OF THE
GAME.). EACH PLAYER IN TURN PLACES ONE DISC ON THE BOARD [BY ENTERING
Y,X TO 'YOUR MOVE'] AND MUST OUTFLANK THE OPPOSITION BY SURROUNDING
ONE OR MORE ROWS OF HIS OPPONENT'S DISCS [THERE CAN BE ONE DISK IN A
ROW] WITH ONE OF HIS OWN. AFTER DOING SO THE ENTIRE ROW BECOMES HIS.
THE WINNER IS THE PLAYER WITH THE MOST DISCS OF HIS COLOR ON THE 
BOARD WHEN ALL DISCS HAVE BEEN PLAYED. THE STRATEGY COMES IN PLANNING
WHERE TO OUTFLANK TO GAIN THE MOST DISCS OR TO MANEUVER PIECES TO
THE STRONGEST POWER POSITIONS ON THE BOARD.
	THIS COMPUTER VERSION WAS DESIGNED NOT ONLY TO PLAY A REASONABLE
GAME WITH A HUMAN OPPONENT, BUT ALSO TO AID IN PERFECTING OUR GAME.
THE FOLLOWING LISTING WAS WRITTEN IN BASIC-E A DISK BASED MICROCOMPUTER
LANGUAGE SUPPORTED BY IMSAI AND OTHERS. IT WILL RUN ON ANY CP/M BASED
8080/Z80 SYSTEM. THE GAME IS AVAILABLE FROM THE MEMORY MERCHANTS ON
DISK OR AS A NON-DISK VERSION FOR TDL'S EXTENDED BASIC. THE LISTING CAN
BE MODIFIED TO SUIT MOST ANY BASIC BY DELETING THE DISK ACCESS ROUTINES,
INCLUDING LINE NUMBERS AND SHORTENING SOME OF THE VARIABLE NAMES [BASIC
-E IS FREE FORMATTED AND ONLY REQUIRES LINE NUMBERS FOR GOTO'S AND GOSUB
'S AND ALSO ALLOWS VARIABLE NAMES UP TO 31 CHARACTERS].
	THIS VERSION HAS ELEVEN OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THE USER. THEY
ARE IMPLEMENTED BY RESPONDING TO 'YOUR MOVE' WITH A 0,# ,WHERE '#'
IS A NUMBER FROM 0-10. COMMANDS 0,0 AND 0,5 ALLOW YOU TO SAVE THE
CURRENT GAME ON THE DISK [0,5 SAVES IT WITH THE NAME DESIGNATED AT
THE BEGINING OF THE GAME. 0,0 ALLOWS YOU TO CHANGE THE NAME OF THE
DISK FILE]. IN THE EVENT YOU HAVE NO LEGAL MOVES, YOU MAY FORFEIT
A MOVE AND LET YOUR OPPONENT TAKE AN EXTRA MOVE.  THIS IS DONE BY
THE COMMAND 0,1 [IF YOU USE THIS COMMAND AND THERE ARE LEGAL MOVES
A LIST OF YOUR LEGAL MOVES WILL APPEAR]. COMMANDS 0,2 AND 0,3 ARE
COMPLIMENTARY, COMMAND 0,3 EXCHANGES THE PIECES AND LETS YOU PLAY
THE COMPUTERS CURRENT POSITION, AND, COMMAND 0,2 EXCHANGES THE
PIECES BUT ALSO SWITCHES THE PLAY TO THE COMPUTER TO RETAIN THE
PROPER CONTINUITY. COMMAND 0,4 ENDS THE GAME [FOR CHICKENS!!].
COMMAND 0,6 PITS THE COMPUTER AGAINST ITSELF [AUTO COMMAND].
COMMANDS 0,7  0,8 AND 0,9 ARE USED TO SET UP THE BOARD, MOVE A 
PIECE AND DELETE A PIECE RESPECTIVELY. TRY THEM THEY ARE SELF
EXPLANATORY. FINALLY COMMAND 0,10 LISTS THE AVAILABLE COMMANDS IN CASE
YOUR MEMORY BANK HAS A GLITCH.
