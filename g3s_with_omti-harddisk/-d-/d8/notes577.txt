Program Description:
 
C Tutor is a comprehensive course for the C programming
language.  Since C is a very transportable language, the des-
cription here is applicable to most compilers with some slight
differences.  This course is recommended for the experienced
programmer who knows about computer programming concepts and 
and has used some other high level language.  This is a two disk 
product.  The first diskette contains the tutorial text and it is
recommended that it be printed by use of an included batch file.
The second diskette contains the C source code for each of
the examples included throughout the tutorial.  These examples
are meant to be studied and then compiled and run by the student.
The examples are short and focus in on the topic of discussion.
A description of the various compilers and their differences is 
included in a text file named COMPILER.DOC to aid you in getting
the source files to compile.  All of the points of C language, 
including proper structured programming techniques, are covered 
at the elementary to he more sophisticated levels in easy to read, 
well written text.  The authors appear to be highly skilled in both 
the use of the programming language and the art of instructional 
design.  Required, of course, is a complete IBM hardware
setup, including at least one disk drive, and some version of a C
compiler.  Also available, in similar format, is a tutorial on the
Pascal programming language.
