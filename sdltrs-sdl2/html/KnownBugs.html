<h3><u>Bugs and limitations</u></h3>

<p>The emulated serial port's modem status and control signals are not tied
to the signals on the real serial port, because the real signals are not
available to software through the Unix tty device interface. The ability to
check for parity, framing, and overrun errors and receive an interrupt when
one occurs is not emulated. Unix does not support 2000, 3600, or 7200 baud,
so these TRS-80 data rates are remapped to 38400, 57600, and 115200 baud
respectively.</p>

<p>Some features of the floppy disk controller are not currently emulated:
Force Interrupt with condition bits 0x01, 0x02, or 0x04 is not implemented.
Read Track is implemented only for DMK emulated floppies. The multiple-sector
flags in Read and Write are not implemented. The timing of returned sectors
is emulated only for the Read Address command, and not very accurately for
JV1 or JV3. If a disk has more than one sector with the same number on a
track, SDLTRS will always see the first (counting from the index hole) when
reading or writing; a real machine would see the next one to come under the
head depending on the current rotational position of the disk. Partially
reformatting a track (which TRS-80 programs like HyperZap and Model I Super
Utility do to achieve mixed density) is supported for DMK but not JV3;
however, switching densities while formatting (which Model III and 4 Super
Utility do) works on both DMK and JV3.</p>

<p>Real physical floppy disks are supported only under Linux, because the
other OS's does not define a portable interface to the low-level floppy
controller functionality that SDLTRS needs, or support the floppy controllers
themselves. There are some limitations even under Linux: Index holes are
faked, not detected on the real disk, and the timing of returned sectors is
not emulated at all. Due to the limitations of PC-style floppy disk
controllers, when formatting a physical floppy under SDLTRS, you cannot mix
sectors of different sizes on the same track, switch densities in the middle
of a track, or reformat only part of a track. However, SDLTRS can read and
write to physical floppies that have already been formatted in these ways
(perhaps by a real TRS-80).</p>

<p>The extended JV3 limit of 5802 sectors is somewhat arbitrary. It could be
raised by generalizing the code to permit more than two blocks of 2901, but
this does not seem too useful. 5802 sectors is already enough for a 3.5-inch
HD (1.44MB) floppy, which the TRS-80 didn't support anyway. If you need more
space, use emulated hard drives instead of emulated floppies with huge
numbers of tracks.</p>

<p>XTRSHARD/DCT ignores the internal write-protected flag in hard drive
images, but a hard drive image can still be effectively write protected by
turning off its Unix write permission bits.</p>

<p>The emulator uses a heuristic to decide what format a ROM file is in. If a
raw binary ROM image starts with 0x01, 0x05, or 0x22, it can be misidentified
as being in a different format. This is rather unlikely to occur, as ROMs
typically begin with 0xF3, the DI instruction.</p>

<p>If you discover other bugs, write fixes for any of these, or make any
other enhancements, please let us know so that we can incorporate the changes
into future releases.</p>
