<h2><u>Options</u></h2>

<p>All of the below options can be specified as command line options.</p>

<p>The same options are used in configuration files by removing the leading
'-', and adding a following '=' if a parameter is included. (i.e <code>-model
1</code> becomes <code>model=1</code>).</p>

<p>Also on the command line, any command line arguments ending in
<code>.t8c</code> will be assumed to be a configuration file, and those
options will be loaded before startup of the emulator. Any command line
arguments ending in <code>.t8s</code> will be assumed to be a state file,
and that state will be restored upon startup of the emulator. A command line
argument ending in <code>.cmd</code> will be assumed to be a CMD file and
will be executed upon startup of the emulator.</p>

              -charset4 <u>name</u></code></td>
    <td>Select among several sets of built-in character bitmaps.
        The three different options allow you to specify the character
        set used for each model, should you change models during SDLTRS
        execution using the GUI. In Model I mode (<code>-charset1</code>),
        seven sets are available. The default, <code>wider</code>, is a
        modified Model III set with characters 8 pixels wide; it looks better
        on a modern computer screen with square pixels than the real Model I
        fonts, which were 6 pixels wide. <code>lcmod</code> is the character
        set in the replacement character generator that was supplied with the
        Radio Shack lower case modification. (It was reconstructed partly from
        memory and may have some minor bit errors.) <code>stock</code> is the
        character set in the stock character generator supplied with most upper
        case only machines. Since SDLTRS currently always emulates the extra
        bit of display memory needed to support lower case, this character set
        gives you the authentic, unpleasant effect that real Model I users saw
        when they tried to do homebrew lower case modifications without
        replacing the character generator: lower case letters appear at an
        inconsistent height, and if you are using the Level II BASIC ROM
        display driver, upper case letters are replaced by meaningless symbols.
        <code>early</code> is the same as <code>stock</code>, but with the
        standard ASCII characters [, \, ], and ^ in the positions where most
        Model I's had directional arrows. This was the default programming in
        the Motorola character generator ROM that Radio Shack used, and a few
        early machines were actually shipped with this ROM. <code>genie</code>
        or <code>german</code> gives an emulation of the Genie I/II (relabled
        Video Genie in Germany) with german characters. <code>ht-1080z</code>
        or <code>hungarian</code> emulates the HT-1080Z (relabled Video Genie in
        Hungary) with accented hungarian characters. <code>meritum</code> for
        the uppercase only charset of this TRS-80 Model I clone from Mera-Elzab
        in Poland. <code>videogenie</code> displays the character set of the
        EACA Video Genie (also labeled as the System 80 in Australia/New Zealand
        and PMC-80/81 in North America). <code>ct-80</code> selects the charset
        of the Aster CT-80, a dutch improved and extended Model I clone.<br>
        In Model III (<code>-charset3</code>), 4 and 4P (<code>-charset4</code>)
        modes, three sets are available: <code>katakana</code> (the default for
        Model III) is the original Model III set with Japanese Katakana
        characters in the alternate character positions. This set was also used
        in early Model 4's. <code>international</code> (the default for Model 4
        and 4P) is a later Model 4 set with accented Roman letters in the
        alternate positions. <code>bold</code> is a bold set from a character
        generator ROM found in one Model III, origin uncertain.
        The name of the character set may be abbreviated to one character.</td>

        Whenever the Z80 program reads the keyboard matrix and sees an emulated
        key go up or down, SDLTRS waits cycles Z80 clock cycles (T-states)
        before it allows the program to see another key transition.
        Key transitions that are received during the waiting period or when the
        Z80 program is not reading the keyboard are held in a queue.

        the end of the list; those drives will get the default values.
        Setting one or more of the first four drives to 8-inch may be useful
        for CP/M software that supports 8-inch drives. You can also use
        XTRS8/DCT with 8-inch drives in the first four positions; even
        though the prompt suggests the unit number must be 4-7, numbers
        0-3 are accepted. XTRS8 does not check whether the unit you've
        selected is really being emulated as an 8-inch drive, however;
        you'll simply get errors during FORMAT if you get this wrong.</td>
