<h2><a name="Main_Menu"></a><u>Main Menu</u></h2>

<p><img alt="Main Menu" src="images/MainMenu.png"></p>

<p>The main menu is the entry point for the Text GUI. You may move up and down
through the menu items using the arrow keys. The <b>Home</b> and <b>End</b>
keys moves to the first or last menu item. Typing the first letter of a menu
item marks it for selection. Pressing a number key from <b>0</b> to <b>9</b>
jumps to the line in the menu. A menu item may be selected by pressing the
<b>Enter</b>, <b>Insert</b>, <b>Space</b> or <b>Tab</b> key when the item is
highlighted. Pressing <b>F7</b>, <b>BackSpace</b> or <b>ESC</b> moves up a
menu level (or exits the GUI if you are at the top level). Besides entering
the GUI using <b>F7</b>, <b>Alt-M</b> or <b>Alt-Comma</b>, submenus may be
entered by using the key shortcuts shown after the menu items.</p>

<h2><a name="Floppy_Disk_Management"></a><u>Floppy Disk Management</u></h2>

<p><img alt="Floppy Menu" src="images/FloppyMenu.png"></p>

<p>The floppy disk management menu allows you to insert and remove floppy
images into the emulated drives, as well as save and load disk sets, create
new disk images, and set emulated disk drive options.</p>

<p>For the first 8 options in the menu, there are three options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hitting <b>Enter</b>, <b>Insert</b> or <b>Tab</b> while the item
      is selected, will move to the disk image selection screen.</li>
  <li>Hitting <b>Delete</b> will remove a disk image in the drive.</li>
  <li>Hitting <b>Space</b> will toggle the write protect for the drive.
      The indicator for write protect is an asterisk "*" in front of the
      "Disk" in the menu item.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Save Disk Set:</h3>

<p>This option allows the user to save the names of the disk images that are
currently in the drives to a file, to be loaded later. The file that the set
is save in has an extension of <code>.set</code>, and it is a human readable
text file, containing the paths of the image files, or a blank line for a
drive for a drive that has no disk.</p>

<h3>Load Disk Set:</h3>

<p>This button allows the user to load a disk set saved earlier with the Save
Disk Set Button. The user is allowed to browse for the set file, displaying
files ending in <code>.set</code>. The emulator then loads the disk images
specified in the file into the corresponding drives. If a drive in the set
file is a blank line, no changes are made to the drive. This allows the user
to load multiple disk sets sequentially.</p>

<p><img alt="Floppy Selection" src="images/FloppyLoad.png"></p>

<p>When the user presses <b>Enter</b> on a Drive item in the Floppy Disk
Management screen, the file open menu is displayed. The arrow keys and page
up/down may be used to scroll through the list of files. <b>Home</b> and
<b>End</b> moves to beginning or end of the list. Pressing <b>Enter</b> on the
&lt;..&gt; item will take you to the parent directory. On Windows, the Drive
letters are listed as the last items in the menu, and you can change drives by
pressing <b>Enter</b> on those items. You may also go to a particular section
of the file list by pressing the first letter of the file name.</p>

<p><img alt="Floppy Creation Menu" src="images/FloppyCreationMenu.png"></p>

<p>In the Floppy Creation screen, you may choose a format of a disk. It may
be created in either the JV1, JV3, or DMK disk image format (See the <a
href="Features.html#Emulated_5-inch_floppy_disks">Features</a> page for info
on the disk formats).</p>

<p>If the "Insert Created Disk Into This Drive" is set to something besides
none, the created image will be mounted on the specified floppy drive.</p>

<p><img alt="Floppy Options Menu" src="images/FloppyOptionsMenu.png"></p>

<p>The first eight items allows you to set the size of each disk drive, as
either a 5" or 8" drive.</p>

<h3>Floppy Disk Controller:</h3>

<p>Enables or disables the Floppy Disk Controller (Expansion Interface) of the
TRS-80. Without activated FDC, ROM BASIC is booted and access to floppy disks
is not possible.</p>

<h3>Doubler Type:</h3>

<p>Specify what type of double density adaptor to emulate (Model I mode only).
The type may be <b>Percom</b>, <b>Tandy</b>, <b>Both</b>, or <b>None</b>. The
default is <b>Both</b>, which causes the double density adaptor emulation to
respond to the special commands of both the Percom and Tandy cards.</p>

<h3>True DAM Emulation:</h3>

<p>Turn off the single density data address mark remapping kludges described
in the "Emulated floppy disks" and "Real floppy disks" sections above. With
this option given, the distinction between F8 and FA data address marks is
strictly observed on both writing and reading. This option is probably not
useful unless you need to deal with Model I disks that use the distinction as
part of a copy-protection scheme.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> only on Linux there is the last menu that allows to set the
drive steps for real floppys:</p>

<p><img alt="Floppy Steps Menu" src="images/FloppyStepMenu.png"></p>

<h2><a name="Hard_Disk_Management"></a><u>Hard Disk Management</u></h2>

<p><img alt="Hard Disk Menu" src="images/HardMenu.png"></p>

<p>The hard disk management menu allows you to insert and remove floppy
images into the emulated drives, as well as save and load disk sets and
create new disk images.</p>

<p>For the first 4 options in the menu, there are three options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hitting <b>Enter</b>, <b>Insert</b> or <b>Tab</b> while the item is
      selected, will move to the image selection screen, which is explained
      above in the floppy disk section.</li>
  <li>Hitting <b>Delete</b> will remove a disk image in the drive.</li>
  <li>Hitting <b>Space</b> will toggle the write protect for the drive.
      The indicator for write protect is an asterisk "*" in front of the
      "Hard" in the menu item.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Save Disk Set:</h3>

<p>This option allows the user to save the names of the disk images that are
currently in the drives to a file, to be loaded later. The file that the set
is save in has an extension of <code>.set</code>, and it is a human readable
text file, containing the paths of the image files, or a blank line for a
drive for a drive that has no disk.</p>

<h3>Load Disk Set:</h3>

<p>This button allows the user to load a disk set saved earlier with the Save
Disk Set Button. The user is allowed to browse for the set file, displaying
files ending in <code>.set</code>. The emulator then loads the disk images
specified in the file into the corresponding drives. If a drive in the set
file is a blank line, no changes are made to the drive. This allows the user
to load multiple disk sets sequentially.</p>

<p>The next three options allows you to specify parameters for creating a hard
disk image (See the <a href="Features.html#Emulated_hard_disks">Features</a>
page for info on the hard disk formats).</p>

<p>If the "Insert Created Disk Into This Drive" is set to something besides
none, the created image will be mounted on the specified hard drive.</p>

<p>The final option allows you to create a blank hard disk image.</p>

<h2><a name="Cassette_Management"></a><u>Cassette Management</u></h2>

<p><img alt="Cassette / Tape Menu" src="images/CassetteMenu.png"></p>

<p>The cassette management menu allows you to insert and remove cassette
images into the emulated drive, as well as create new cassette images.</p>

<p>For the first option in the menu, there are three options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hitting <b>Enter</b>, <b>Insert</b> or <b>Tab</b> while the item is
      selected, will move to the image selection screen, which is explained
      above in the floppy disk section.</li>
  <li>Hitting <b>Delete</b> will remove a cassette image in the drive.</li>
  <li>Hitting <b>Space</b> will toggle the write protect for the cassette.
      The indicator for write protect is an asterisk "*" in front of the
      "Cass" in the menu item.</li>
</ul>

<p>The second option allows you to set the position of the cassette tape by
changing the Position field. Valid values are 0 (fully rewound) through the
number of bytes on the tape (at end of tape).</p>

<p>The third option allows you to define the default sample rate in Hz.</p>

<p>The fourth option allows you to choose a format of a cassette
(<code>.cas</code> or <code>.wav</code>).</p>

<p>If the "Insert Created Cassette Into Drive" is set to Yes, the created
image will be used in the cassette drive.</p>

<p>The final option allows you to create a blank cassette image.</p>

<h2><a name="Stringy_Wafer_Management"></a><u>Stringy Wafer Management</u></h2>

<p><img alt="Stringy Wafer Menu" src="images/StringyMenu.png"></p>

<p>The stringy wafer management menu allows you to insert and remove wafer
images into the emulated drives, as well as save and load disk sets, and
create new wafer images with default parameters.</p>

<p>For the first 8 options in the menu, there are three options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hitting <b>Enter</b>, <b>Insert</b> or <b>Tab</b> while the item is
      selected, will move to the image selection screen, which is explained
      above in the floppy disk section.</li>
  <li>Hitting <b>Delete</b> will remove a wafer image in the drive.</li>
  <li>Hitting <b>Space</b> will toggle the write protect for the wafer.
      The indicator for write protect is an asterisk "*" in front of the
      "Wafer" in the menu item.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Emulator_Settings"></a><u>Emulator Settings</u></h2>

<p><img alt="Emulator Settings Menu" src="images/EmulatorMenu.png"></p>

<h3>Model:</h3>

<p>Specifies what TRS-80 model to emulate. Selecting a different model will
perform a "Cold Boot" in the Emulator after exiting the Emulator Settings.</p>

<h3>CPU Clock Speed:</h3>

<p>The default CPU speed of the selected TRS-80 model can be changed here,
but use this with CAUTION: overclocking the Z80 will result in all forms of
"timing-errors"!</p>

<h3>Speedup Kit Emulation:</h3>

<p>Selects the speed-up modification for the TRS-80 Model I: <b>None</b>,
<b>Archbold</b>, <b>Holmes</b> or <b>Seatronics</b>. Select <b>Banking</b>
for memory banking (by Martin Doppelbauer) on I/O-port <code>0xFE</code>.
<b>LNW80</b> sets the CPU clock to 4 MHz and enables banking for the 480*192
HRG in the lower 16 KB. Use <b>TCS SpeedMaster</b> for this enhanced Model I
clone running at 5.35 MHz, with 480*192 HRG and memory banking support. Set
<b>CT-80 Aster</b> for emulation of the dutch TRS-80 model I clone.</p>

<h3>Exatron Stringy Floppy:</h3>

<p>Emulates up to 8 Stringy Floppy Drives for the TRS-80 Model I.</p>

<h3>Lowercase:</h3>

<p>Emulate a "Lowercase Modification Kit" for the TRS-80 Model I.</p>

<h3>Lubomir:</h3>

<p>Emulates the "Lubomir Soft Banker" from Schmidtke electronic (Germany)
for the TRS-80 Model I.</p>

<h3>Graphics Emulations:</h3>

<p>In Model III or 4/4P mode select which Hi-Res graphics card to emulate,
the Micro-Labs Grafyx Solution Hi-Res graphics card or Radio Shack Hi-Res
card. In Model I mode, the HRG1B 384x192 Hi-Res graphics card is emulated.
Note that the Model III and Model 4/4P cards from Micro-Labs are very
different from one another.</p>

<p>The Lowe Electronics LE18 Graphics Adapter can also be emulated.</p>

<h3>Memory Expansions:</h3>

<p>Various memory expansions can be emulated for a total of 4 MB RAM.</p>

<h2><a name="Display_Settings"></a><u>Display Settings</u></h2>

<p><img alt="Display Settings Menu" src="images/DisplayMenu.png"></p>

<h3>Emulator Colors:</h3>

<p>Specifies the foreground and background color of the SDLTRS window.
Default is white (<code>0xE0E0FF</code>) for foreground and black
(<code>0x000000</code>) for background.</p>

<h3>GUI Colors:</h3>

<p>Specifies the foreground and background color of the fullscreen Text GUI.
Default is white (<code>0xE0E0FF</code>) for foreground and dark green
(<code>0x344843</code>) for background.</p>

<h3>Character Sets:</h3>

<p>Select among several sets of built-in character bitmaps. The three
different options allow you to specify the character set used for each model,
should you change models during SDLTRS execution using the GUI. In Model I
mode, seven sets are available. The default, <b>Wider</b>, is a modified
Model III set with characters 8 pixels wide; it looks better on a modern
computer screen with square pixels than the real Model I fonts, which were 6
pixels wide. <b>LCmod</b> is the character set in the replacement character
generator that was supplied with the Radio Shack lower case modification.
<b>Stock</b> is the character set in the stock character generator supplied
with most upper case only machines. Since SDLTRS currently always emulates
the extra bit of display memory needed to support lower case, this character
set gives you the authentic, unpleasant effect that real Model I users saw
when they tried to do homebrew lower case modifications without replacing the
character generator: lower case letters appear at an inconsistent height,
and if you are using the Level II BASIC ROM display driver, upper case letters
are replaced by meaningless symbols. early is the same as stock, but with the
standard ASCII characters [, \, ], and ^ in the positions where most Model
I's had directional arrows. This was the default programming in the Motorola
character generator ROM that Radio Shack used, and a few early machines were
actually shipped with this ROM. <b>Genie</b> gives an emulation of the Genie
I/II (relabled Video Genie in Germany) with German characters ("Umlauts").
<b>HT-1080Z</b> emulates the HT-1080Z (relabled Video Genie in Hungary) with
accented Hungarian characters. <b>Meritum I</b> is the uppercase charset of
a TRS-80 Model I clone in Poland, build by Mera-Elzab. <b>Video Genie</b>
displays the character set of the EACA Video Genie (also labeled as the System
80 in Australia/New Zealand and PMC-80/81 in North America). <b>CT-80 Aster
</b> is the character set of the dutch, improved TRS-80 Model I clone.</p>

<p>In Model III, 4 and 4P modes, three sets are available:</p>

<p><b>Katakana</b> (the default for Model III) is the original Model III set
with Japanese Katakana characters in the alternate character positions. This
set was also used in early Model 4's. <b>International</b> (the default for
Model 4 and 4P) is a later Model 4 set with accented Roman letters in the
alternate positions. <b>Bold</b> is a bold set from a character generator ROM
found in one Model III, origin uncertain.</p>

<h3>Window Border Width:</h3>

<p>Put a border of width pixels around the TRS-80 display. default is 2.</p>

<h3>Resize Window on Model 3 Mode Change:</h3>

<p>In Model 3 mode, resize the window whenever the emulated display mode
changes between 64x16 text (or 512x192 graphics) and 80x24 text (or 640x240
graphics).</p>

<h3>Resize Window on Model 4 Mode Change:</h3>

<p>In Model 4/4P mode, resize the window whenever the emulated display mode
changes between 64x16 text (or 512x192 graphics) and 80x24 text (or 640x240
graphics).</p>

<h3>Scale Factor for Window:</h3>

<p>This options allows scaling of the SDLTRS window by the selected factor:
"none", "2 x", "3 x" or "4 x".<p>

<h3>LED Display for Disks and Turbo Mode:</h3>

<p>This option allows the user to chose if disk activity indicators and
Turbo Mode LED are shown in the TRS-80 Emulator window (lower edge).</p>

<h3>Display Scanlines:</h3>

<p>This option draws Scanlines on every second line of the emulator screen
to simulate the pixel resolution of an old CRT monitor. The brightness of
the scanlines can be adjusted from 0 (= dark) to 255 (= light).</p>


<h2><a name="Miscellaneous_Settings"></a><u>Miscellaneous Settings</u></h2>

<p><img alt="Miscellaneous Settings Menu" src="images/MiscMenu.png"></p>

<h3>Close and Reopen Printer Output File:</h3>

<p>Selecting this option will cause the printer output file to be closed, and
the next file will be automatically created.</p>

<h3>Emulator Traps Safe:</h3>

<p>Turn on/off ability for emts (Emulation traps) to write to unexpected
places in the host filesystem.</p>

<h3>Fake year for TRS-80 time-of-day-clock:</h3>

<p>Set the year for TRS-80 time-of-day clock instead of the current year.
This can useful for TRS-80 operating systems that behave better when the year
is within a limited range. Enter year including the century or <code>0</code>
(default setting) to use the current year.</p>

<h3>Keystretch Value:</h3>

<p>Fine-tune the keyboard behavior. To prevent keystrokes from being lost,
SDLTRS "stretches" the intervals between key transitions, so that the Z80
program has time to see each transition before the next one occurs. Whenever
the Z80 program reads the keyboard matrix and sees an emulated key go up or
down, SDLTRS waits cycles Z80 clock cycles (T-states) before it allows the
program to see another key transition. Key transitions that are received
during the waiting period or when the Z80 program is not reading the
keyboard are held in a queue. The default stretch value is 4000 cycles; it
should seldom if ever be necessary to change it.</p>

<h3>Printer Type:</h3>

<p>Controls the type of printer emulation that is used for outputting to the
TRS-80 printer: <b>None</b> and <b>Text</b>.
<b>Text</b> simply sends the printer output to a text file (automatically
created from <code>trsprn0000.txt</code> to <code>trsprn9999.txt</code>).</p>

<h3>Serial Port Name:</h3>

<p>Set the tty device to be used for I/O to the TRS-80's serial port. Setting
the name to be empty emulates having no serial port.</p>

<h3>Serial Port Switches:</h3>

<p>Set the sense switches on the Model I serial port card. This option is
meaningful only in Model I mode, and only when the Serial Port Name is not
set to "". The default value is <code>0x6f</code>, which Radio Shack software
conventionally interprets as 9600 bps, 8 bits/word, no parity, 1 stop bit.</p>

<h3>Shift Bracket Emulation:</h3>

<p>Chose Shift Bracket Emulation on or off. If on, emulate [, \, ], ^, and _
as shifted keys, and {, |, }, and ~ as unshifted. This is the default in
Model 4 and 4P modes, and it works well with the keyboard driver in Model 4
TRSDOS/LS-DOS 6. If off, emulate [, \, ], ^, and _ as unshifted keys, and
{, |, }, and ~ as shifted. This is the default in Model I and III modes, and
it works well with many TRS-80 keyboard drivers. With some keyboard drivers
these keys do not work at all, however.</p>

<h3>Sound Output:</h3>

<p>Turn Sound Output on or off. The <b>Alt-U</b> key binding may be used to
switch Sound Output on or off while running the emulator.</p>

<h3>Turbo Mode:</h3>

<p>This will turn Turbo mode on or off. When turbo mode is on, the emulator
will run faster than a normal TRS-80, by a factor of Turbo Rate, which is
explained below, and also set on this page. The <b>F12</b> key or <b>Alt-N</b>
may be used to switch Turbo mode on or off while running the emulator.</p>

<h3>Turbo Speed:</h3>

<p>Set the number of times normal TRS-80 speed that the emulator runs when in
"Turbo" mode. Turbo mode can be used to speed compute intensive applications,
compiling source code for example, on the emulator. The default setting is
5x. Above around 8x you may experience problems with runaway keyboard repeat
on the emulator, so use higher values with caution.</p>

<h3>Turbo Paste:</h3>

<p>While pasting from the clipboard to the TRS-80 emulator, Turbo mode is
temporarily activated.</p>
